# Hokodate Course

## Overview
Like the Kisakata Course, this is the most popular course on Mt. Chokai, starting from Hokodate (elevation 1,150m) near the Akita-side gate of the Chokai Blue Line. Hikers walk along a ridge with good views, join the Kisakata Course at Mihama Hut, and then head for the summit.

## Course Data
- **Round-trip time**: Approx. 7 hours 30 minutes
- **Standard Route**: Hokodate → Sainokawara → Mihama Hut (approx. 1 hr 30 min) → Shimekake → Odagahara Junction → Outer Rim/Senjadani Junction → Omuro Hut → Shinzan Summit

## Highlights
- **Hokodate Observatory**: Right from the start, you can enjoy superb views of the Sea of Japan and the "Kujuku-shima" islands of Kisakata.
- **Sainokawara**: A rest spot where spring water flows. The serious climbing begins from here.
- **Mihama Hut and Lake Chokai**: The junction point with the Fukura and Kisakata courses, serving as a hub for rest and information exchange.

## Hiking Advice
- The path is clear due to the large number of hikers, but the trail is often rocky, so watch your step.
- The weather can change suddenly even in summer. Always carry rain gear and warm clothing.
- The trailhead is at a high elevation, and you reach high altitudes relatively quickly, so be cautious of altitude sickness.

## Access
- **By Car**: From the Nihonkai-Tohoku Expressway "Kisakata IC," take the Chokai Blue Line to the parking lot at Hokodate.
- **By Bus**: Use the shared mountain bus (seasonal operation) from JR Kisakata Station.
