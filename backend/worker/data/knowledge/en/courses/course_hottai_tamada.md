# Hottai Waterfall & Tamada Valley Course

## Overview
This course takes you to the famous "Hottai Waterfall," selected as one of "Japan's Top 100 Waterfalls," and the beautiful "Tamada Valley". A walking path utilizing an old forest railway has been developed, allowing you to enjoy the varied beauty of the valley while walking through a beech forest.

## Course Data
- **Round-trip time**: Approx. 3 hours 00 minutes
- **Standard Route**: Course Entrance (Kobo-daira) → Ichino-taki Entrance (30 min) → End of Valley Forest Road Course (45 min)

## Highlights
- **Hottai Waterfall**: A beautiful, famous waterfall with a drop of 57.4m, collecting water from Mt. Chokai. Its abundant flow never runs dry. The surrounding autumn foliage is particularly beautiful, with the best viewing time in mid-October.
- **Tamada Valley**: A beautiful valley with a continuous beech forest. Along the way, you can also see potholes ("ouketsu"), which are circular holes in the rock bed formed by the water flow.
- **Kobo-daira**: A place where the great monk Kobo Daishi is said to have trained. You can also access Tamada Valley from here via a forest road.

## Hiking Advice
- The footing is relatively good as it is a forest road course, but some natural paths are narrow and face the slope, so please walk safely.
- In midsummer, there are many insects like horseflies, so countermeasures are necessary.

## Access
About a 60-minute drive south on National Route 108 from Yurihonjo city center. You can drive from the course entrance at Kobo-daira to the junction point. There is a large park in front of Hottai Waterfall, equipped with a parking lot, rest house, shops, and camping facilities.
