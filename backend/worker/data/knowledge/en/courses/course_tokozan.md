# Mt. Toko Course

## Overview
This course climbs the sacred peak of Mt. Toko (elevation 592m), which has been an object of mountain worship since ancient times. It is relatively close to the city, allowing for a casual trekking experience. From the summit, you can see the Sea of Japan in the distance.

## Course Data
- **Round-trip time**: Approx. 2 hours 10 minutes
- **Standard Route**: Trailhead → 5th Station Bishamon-do Hall (40 min) → 7th Station (25 min) → Summit (20 min)

## Highlights
- **View from the Summit**: On a clear day, a wonderful view unfolds, stretching all the way to the Sea of Japan.
- **Great Buddha of Akada (Chokoku-ji Temple)**: At Chokoku-ji Temple near the trailhead, a golden Great Buddha statue, about 9m tall, is enshrined and is counted as one of the "Three Great Hase Kannon of Japan".

## Hiking Advice
- The path is relatively gentle up to the Bishamon-do Hall at the 5th station, but it becomes a somewhat steep climb to the 7th station.
- The footing is relatively good, but some parts are rocky, so trekking shoes with thick soles are ideal.
- Hiking poles are useful.

## Access
From Yurihonjo city center, head north on National Route 105, pass Chokoku-ji Temple, and aim for the Akada Great Waterfall. The trailhead is just before the entrance to the waterfall, marked by a signpost.
