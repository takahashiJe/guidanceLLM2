# Hachiman/Masuda Course

## Overview
This is a main route from the Sakata City side, starting from the Yunodai Trailhead (elevation 1,250m). The course is also known for summer skiing, as it crosses the vast snowy valley "Senjogahara" and joins the Takinokoya Course after passing the former site of the Kawarajuku Hut.

## Course Data
- **Round-trip time**: Approx. 9 hours
- **Standard Route**: Yunodai Trailhead → Takinokoya Junction → Former Kawarajuku Hut Site → Azami-zaka Slope → (Joins Takinokoya Course) → Shinzan Summit

## Highlights
- **Senjogahara Snowy Valley**: A vast snowy valley remains even in summer, where you can enjoy walking on the snow.
- **Former Kawarajuku Hut Site**: The junction with the Takinokoya Course. A good spot for a break.
- **Alpine Plants**: Flower fields of Miyama-kinpoge (Ranunculus acris var. nipponicus) and Hakusan-ichige (Anemone narcissiflora) spread around the snowy valley.

## Hiking Advice
- **Experience and equipment for walking on snow are required.** It is easy to get lost, especially in poor visibility, and there is a risk of slipping. Crampons and an ice axe are essential.
- Depending on the weather, the snow valley can be hard-frozen, requiring caution.
- Like the Takinokoya Course, this route is for experienced and physically fit hikers.

## Access
- **By Car**: From the Nihonkai-Tohoku Expressway "Sakata Minato IC," take prefectural roads to the Yunodai Trailhead.
