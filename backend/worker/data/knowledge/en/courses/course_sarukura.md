# Sarukura Course

## Overview
This course starts from Sarukura (elevation 600m) on the east side of Mt. Chokai and aims for the outer crater rim. Compared to other main courses, it has fewer hikers and is recommended for those who want to enjoy a quiet mountain walk. On the way, it passes the headwaters of the "Haraigawa" river, known as a habitat for Chokai Marimo.

## Course Data
- **Round-trip time**: Approx. 7 hours
- **Standard Route**: Sarukura Trailhead → Haraigawa → Yunodai-michi Junction → Hikaridai → Sharizaka → Mt. Shichikosan

## Highlights
- **Chokai Marimo**: The national natural monument, Chokai Marimo, grows wild in the clear streams of the Haraigawa river.
- **Quiet Beech Forest**: For a while from the trailhead, you walk through a beautiful beech forest.
