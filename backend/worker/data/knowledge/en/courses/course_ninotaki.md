# Nino-taki & Sanno-taki Falls Course

## Overview
This is a trekking course that visits waterfalls along the upper reaches of the Nasogawa River in Kisakata-machi, Nikaho City. You can enjoy the varied scenery of different waterfalls: "Ichino-taki," where water glides down a giant monolith; the graceful "Nino-taki"; and "Sanno-taki," hidden deep in the primeval forest.

## Course Data
- **Round-trip time**: Approx. 1 hour 30 minutes (to Sanno-taki)
- **Standard Route**: Nino-taki Parking Lot → Nino-taki → Ichino-taki → Sanno-taki

## Highlights
- **Nino-taki (Second Fall)**: A beautiful waterfall located right next to the parking lot.
- **Ichino-taki (First Fall)**: A short walk from Nino-taki, this waterfall flows as if sliding down a single slab of rock.
- **Sanno-taki (Third Fall)**: Located within a primeval beech forest, this is the most impressive waterfall.

## Hiking Advice
- This course is more like a hike than a mountain climb, but the path to Sanno-taki can be slippery in places, so comfortable walking shoes are necessary.
- The scenery is particularly beautiful during the fresh green and autumn foliage seasons.

## Access
- **By Car**: About 20 minutes from the Nihonkai-Tohoku Expressway "Kisakata IC." Use the parking lot at Nino-taki.
