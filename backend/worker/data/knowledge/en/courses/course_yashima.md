# Yashima Course

## Overview
This course ascends from Yashima-machi in Yurihonjo City, with the trailhead at Haraikawa (elevation 1,150m) at the 5th station. It begins with the beautiful scenery of the Ryugahara Wetland, passes over Mt. Shichikosan (elevation 2,229m), and then descends the outer crater rim before climbing again to reach Mt. Chokai's highest peak, Shinzan.

## Course Data

- **Standard Route**: Haraikawa → Nanatsugama Emergency Hut → Koshin-do Junction → Mt. Shichikosan → Omonoimi Shrine → Shinzan Summit

## Highlights
- **Ryugahara Wetland**: A wetland spreading out right in front of the trailhead. Alpine plants bloom in profusion in the summer.
