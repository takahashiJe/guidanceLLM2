# Kisakata Course

## Overview
This is one of the most popular courses, starting from Hokodate (elevation 1,150m) near the Akita Prefecture side gate of the Chokai Blue Line. It passes through "Sainokawara," which offers great views from its observatory, and the "Odagahara" wetland, beautiful with alpine plants, before joining the Fukura Course at Mihama Hut.

## Course Data
- **Round-trip time**: Approx. 8 hours 30 minutes
- **Standard Route**: Hokodate → Sainokawara → Mihama Hut (approx. 1 hr 30 min) → (Joins Fukura Course) → Shinzan Summit

## Highlights
- **Hokodate Observatory**: From the starting point, a superb view of the Sea of Japan and the "Kujuku-shima" islands of Kisakata unfolds.
- **Sainokawara**: A place with a white torii gate where spring water flows, making it a suitable spot for a break.

## Hiking Advice
- The path is clear as many hikers use it, but there are rocky and scree areas, so sturdy hiking boots are necessary.
