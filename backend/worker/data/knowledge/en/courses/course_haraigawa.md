# Haraikawa Area Course

## Overview
This is a walking course around the Haraikawa Hutte at the 5th station, which is the base for climbing Mt. Chokai (Yashima Trailhead). In the "Ryugahara Wetland," which spreads out in front of the hut, a wooden boardwalk is maintained, allowing you to feel the alpine plants and the blessings of Mt. Chokai's water firsthand.

## Course Data
- **Round-trip time**: Approx. 2 hours 30 minutes
- **Standard Route**: Haraikawa Hutte → (Boardwalk) → Aka-taki Falls (20 min) → Water Source (20 min) → (Return to junction) → Kara-taki Falls (20 min)

## Highlights
- **Ryugahara Wetland**: In July, Hiougi-ayame (Iris setosa) is in full bloom, and various alpine plants are distributed here. On a clear day, you can see the Sea of Japan from the observation deck.
- **Kara-taki Falls & Aka-taki Falls**: These are the waterfalls that form the headwaters of the Haraikawa River.
- **Chokai Marimo**: At the water source, you can see the rare "Chokai Marimo" algae balls, nurtured in the clear stream.

## Hiking Advice
- The course to Aka-taki Falls is easy even for beginners.
- The path to Kara-taki Falls has steep descents and ascents, so be mindful of your energy distribution.
- The path to the water source is a steep slope, and the water-wet rocks are slippery, so please be careful.
- Since you will be walking through wetlands, water-resistant shoes are essential.
