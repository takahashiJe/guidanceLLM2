# Mt. Koshiki Area Course

## Overview
This course goes around Mt. Koshiki, located to the east of Mt. Chokai. It is characterized by a pair of stone peaks, the southern peak "Okoshiki" (male peak) and the northern peak "Mekoshiki" (female peak), and the summit offers a magnificent view of the vast sea of trees. In particular, "Meisho-numa Pond" at the foot of Mekoshiki is a beautiful pond with rock islands, popular with many hikers.

## Course Data
- **Round-trip time**: Approx. 2 hours 00 minutes
- **Standard Routes**:
    - Koshiki Forest Road Trailhead → Mid-slope Junction (20 min) → Okoshiki (45 min)
    - Mid-slope Junction → Meisho-numa Pond (10 min)

## Highlights
- **Okoshiki (981m)**: Near the summit is a stone pillar called "Eboshi-iwa" (Eboshi Rock), offering a breathtaking view. The trail is somewhat steep and recommended for experienced hikers.
- **Meisho-numa Pond**: A beautiful pond located directly below the eastern wall of Mekoshiki. Natural rock islands float in the center, charming visitors from the season of fresh greenery to autumn foliage. It is also a habitat for the forest green tree frog (Rhacophorus arboreus).

## Hiking Advice
- The trail to Okoshiki is a bit challenging, so hiking with a companion is recommended.
- The walking course to Meisho-numa Pond can be easily enjoyed even by beginners.
- It is hot in midsummer with many mosquitoes and black flies, so insect repellent is essential.

From National Route 108 near Sasago (Akakura), enter towards Sarukawa, using the lion dance monument as a landmark. After passing Sarukawa, turn left onto the Koshiki Forest Road; the trailhead and parking space (for 5-6 cars) are at a pass-like location.
