# Kuwanokidai Wetland Course

## Overview
This course circles the "Kuwanokidai Wetland," which spreads out near the 3rd station of Mt. Chokai. In early June, the white fluff of cotton grass and the orange flowers of Japanese azalea (Renge-tsutsuji) are in full bloom. You can also enjoy the rich colors of various other alpine plants and wildflowers, such as Mizubasho (Asian skunk-cabbage) and Ezo-rindo (Japanese gentian).

## Course Data
- **Round-trip time**: Approx. 4 hours 00 minutes
- **Standard Route**: Entrance from Prefectural Road → Wetland Entrance (3.3km) → Wetland Circuit (approx. 90 min)

## Highlights
- **Fields of Cotton Grass and Japanese Azalea**: They reach their peak in early June, coloring the wetland.
- **Diverse Wildflowers**: Various flowers bloom each season, such as Mizubasho (June) and Ezo-rindo (September).

## Hiking Advice
- You walk on a forest road to the wetland entrance, and from there, you push through a bit of bush to get to the wetland itself.
- The wetland is often muddy, so water-resistant footwear (rain boots are ideal) is essential.
- There are many horseflies in the summer, so don't forget insect repellent measures.

## Access
From National Route 108, pass through Hanadate Ranch Park. The course entrance is before the Mt. Chokai Yashima Trailhead (before the 3rd station). You can use the parking lot at "Mori no Kyukeijo" (Forest Rest Stop).
