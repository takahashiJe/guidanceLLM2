# Fukura (Oodaira) Course

## Overview
Starting from Oodaira Trailhead (elevation 1,150m) at the end of the Chokai Blue Line, this popular course offers excellent views as it heads to the summit via Lake Chokai and the Mihama Hut. It is a treasure trove of alpine plants and is especially bustling with hikers in the summer.

## Course Data
- **Round-trip time**: Approx. 8 hours 30 minutes
- **Standard Route**: Oodaira Trailhead → Mihama Hut/Lake Chokai (approx. 1 hr 30 min) → Sensumori Peak (approx. 30 min) → Omuro Hut (approx. 2 hrs) → Shinzan Summit (approx. 30 min)

## Highlights
- **Mihama Hut and Lake Chokai**: A mountain hut and a beautiful crater lake located at the midpoint of the course. Lake Chokai is also called "Torinoumi" (Sea of Birds) and has a mystical atmosphere.
- **Alpine Plants**: In summer, many alpine plants such as Chokai-azami (Cirsium chokaiense) and Nikko-kisuge (Hemerocallis esculenta) are in full bloom.
- **Sensumori Peak**: A peak on the way from Mihama to the summit, offering an outstanding view.
- **Omuro Hut**: A mountain hut just below the summit where lodging is available. The final ascent to the summit from here is a steep, rocky climb.

## Hiking Advice
- Although the course is relatively well-maintained, it is a long hike, so a solid plan and proper equipment are necessary.
- Even in summer, temperatures can drop significantly depending on the weather, so warm clothing is essential.
- From Omuro Hut to the summit, climb carefully, paying attention to falling rocks.

## Access
- **By Car**: From the Nihonkai-Tohoku Expressway "Yuza Chokai IC," take Prefectural Route 210 and the Chokai Blue Line to the Oodaira Parking Lot at the end (approx. 50 min from the IC).
- **By Bus**: Take the shared mountain bus "Chokai Blue Liner" (seasonal operation) from JR Fukura Station to Oodaira Trailhead.
