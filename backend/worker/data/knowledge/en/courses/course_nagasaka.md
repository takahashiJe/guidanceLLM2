# Nagasaka Trailhead Course

## Overview
This course starts from Nagasaka in Yuza Town at the southwest foot of Mt. Chokai, and heads for Mihama via Mt. Shogatake (1,635m). It allows for a deep experience of Mt. Chokai's rich nature, including beautiful beech forests and river crossings, but it is long and requires physical strength and experience.

## Course Data
- **Time required**: Ascent: approx. 4 hours 45 minutes (to Mihama)
- **Standard Route**: Nagasaka Trailhead → Kamino-yamanokami → Katamochi-iwa Rock → Scree Slope → Higashi-tatsumaki → Mt. Shogatake → Mihama

## Highlights
- **Primeval Beech Forest**: For a while from the trailhead, you walk through a beautiful beech forest.
- **Mt. Shogatake**: One of Mt. Chokai's parasitic volcanoes, it has a unique shape. The view from here is also a highlight.
- **River Crossings and Streamside Paths**: You will cross several streams, enjoying the cool, waterside scenery.

## Hiking Advice
- **This course is for experienced and physically fit hikers.** There are river crossings, and the water level can rise after snowmelt or heavy rain, making it difficult to pass.
- The path near the summit of Mt. Shogatake can be unclear in some places, so map-reading skills are necessary.
- After reaching Mihama, plan your next move according to your physical condition, whether to aim for the summit or descend to Oodaira Trailhead.

## Access
- **By Car**: From the JR Fukura Station area, take prefectural roads to the trailhead located beyond the Nagasaka village. The road to the trailhead is narrow, so be careful.
