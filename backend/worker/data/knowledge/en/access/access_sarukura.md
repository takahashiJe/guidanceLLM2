This is the trailhead for the Sarukura Course, located on the east side of Mt. Chokai in Yurihonjo City, Akita Prefecture.

## By Car
- **Route**: From National Route 108, take Prefectural Route 32 and head towards the Sarukura village.
- **Parking**: A parking lot is available at the 4th station.
- **Note**: The road to the trailhead is narrow and can be confusing. Please check a map in advance.

## By Public Transportation
- **Nearest Station**: Yuri Kogen Railway "Yajima Station."
- **Bus**: From Yajima Station, transfer between a regular Ugo Kotsu bus and a Yurihonjo City community bus to get to "Sarukura Onsen Chokaiso." From there, it is a 3.5 km walk along the road to the trailhead. Accessing the trailhead solely by public transportation is relatively difficult.
