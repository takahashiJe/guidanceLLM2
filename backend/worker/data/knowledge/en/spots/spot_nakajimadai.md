# Nakajimadai Forest and Shishigahana Wetland

## Overview
This is a trekking area where you can explore both the Nakajimadai Recreational Forest, known for its uniquely shaped giant beech tree called "Agariko Daio," and the Shishigahana Wetland, formed by spring water from Mt. Chokai. You can enjoy both the beech forest and the wetland in a single visit.

## Highlights & Features
- **Agariko Daio**: A giant beech tree over 300 years old that has grown by repeatedly breaking at its base under the weight of snow and then branching out again. Its appearance is as majestic as a king of the forest.
- **Shishigahana Wetland**: A wetland formed where underground water from Mt. Chokai springs to the surface. Here, you can observe a precious ecosystem, including a globally rare community of moss balls (Chokai Marimo).
- **Walking Trails**: Boardwalks and paths are maintained within the forest, allowing you to choose from various courses depending on your fitness level.
