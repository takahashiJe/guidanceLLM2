# Baikamo of the Ushiwatari River

## Overview
This is a small river, about 140 meters long, where the water temperature is kept nearly constant year-round by the underflow water from Mt. Chokai. In its clear stream, the "Baikamo" (water buttercup), an aquatic flower that only grows in pure water, blooms with small, white, plum-blossom-like flowers in the summer.

## Highlights & Features
- **Clear Stream and Baikamo**: The sight of the Baikamo swaying gently in the exceptionally clear river is very refreshing and creates a healing landscape.
- **Salmon Run**: In the fall, you can also witness salmon swimming upstream to spawn.
- **Boardwalk Stroll**: A wooden boardwalk is maintained along the river, allowing you to observe the inside of the river as you walk.
