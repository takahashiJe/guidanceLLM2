# Motodaki Fukuryusui (Motodaki Underflow Water)

## Overview
This is a spring spot where rain and snow that have fallen on Mt. Chokai permeate the earth over many years and re-emerge on the surface. The sight of countless threads of white water cascading down from a wide, moss-covered rock face is incredibly magical and refreshing.

## Highlights & Features
- **A Healing Space**: The underflow water, gushing out over a width of about 30 meters, looks like a white curtain of water. The area is filled with negative ions and a sense of coolness.
- **Seasonal Scenery**: You can enjoy beautiful scenery throughout the year, from the fresh green of spring and the coolness of summer to the colors of autumn.
- **Walking Trail**: A well-maintained path through a beech forest leads from the parking lot to the falls in about a 10-minute walk.
