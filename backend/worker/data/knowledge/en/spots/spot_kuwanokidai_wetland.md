# Kuwanokidai Wetland (Kuwanokidai Shitsugen)

## Overview
Located near the 3rd station of Mt. Chokai, this is a vast wetland where untouched nature remains. The dense colonies of cotton grass, especially in early June, create a fantastical landscape that looks as if it's covered in snow.

## Highlights & Features
- **Cotton Grass and Rhododendrons**: In early June, the white fluff of cotton grass and the orange blossoms of the Japanese rhododendron color the wetland.
- **Diverse Alpine Flora**: You can observe various wildflowers throughout the seasons, such as Asian skunk cabbage and Japanese gentian.
- **Quiet Nature**: Being slightly off the main hiking trail, it has fewer visitors, allowing you to fully enjoy nature in a tranquil atmosphere.

## Basic Information
- **Location**: Yashima-machi, Yurihonjo City, Akita Prefecture
- **Hours**: Daytime (Late May to early November)
- **Fee**: Free
- **Note**: The wetland is very muddy, so waterproof footwear like rain boots is essential.

## Access
- **By Car**: Use the "Mori no Kyukeijo" (Forest Rest Stop) parking lot on the way to the Yashimaguchi (Haraikawaguchi) trailhead, and then access via a forest road on foot.
