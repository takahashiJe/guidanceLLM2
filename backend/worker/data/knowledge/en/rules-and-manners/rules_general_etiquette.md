# Basic Hiking Etiquette

## Overview
To ensure everyone can enjoy hiking safely and pleasantly, there are basic manners that have been passed down among hikers for generations. When visiting Mt. Chokai, please make an effort to follow this etiquette.

## Main Points of Etiquette
- **Uphill Hikers Have the Right of Way**:
    - When passing on a narrow trail, it is basic etiquette to yield to the person hiking uphill. This is because it is easier for the person descending to find a safe place to stop.
    - However, the most important thing is to communicate with each other and yield courteously depending on the situation.
- **Greet Others**:
    - Greet fellow hikers you pass with a "Konnichiwa." Greetings are the first step in communication and also serve as a safety measure by acknowledging each other's presence in case of an emergency.
- **Pack It In, Pack It Out**:
    - It is a golden rule to carry out everything you bring with you, including food wrappers, fruit cores, and tissues. This is one of the most important rules for preserving the beautiful nature for the next person.
- **Be Considerate When in a Group**:
    - Refrain from blocking the trail by resting in a large group or speaking loudly. Be considerate of other hikers who may be passing through or who wish to enjoy nature quietly.
