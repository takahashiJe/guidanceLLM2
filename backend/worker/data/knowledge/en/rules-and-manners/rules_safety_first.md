# Principles of Safe Hiking

## Overview
The most important thing in hiking is for everyone to descend safely. To create wonderful memories, do not neglect safety awareness and preparation.

## Key Points for Safety
- **Sufficient Planning and Preparation**:
    - Choose a course that matches your physical fitness and experience, and create a realistic hiking plan. It is important to allow plenty of extra time for your course schedule.
    - Always carry essential equipment, such as a map, compass, headlamp, rain gear, warm clothing, emergency food, and water.
- **Submit a Climbing Registration Form**:
    - In case of an emergency, **be sure to submit a Climbing Registration Form (Hiking Plan)**. You can drop it in the registration posts at each trailhead or submit it online in advance.
- **Check the Weather**:
    - Mountain weather is highly unpredictable. Check the forecast before you leave and pay attention to worsening conditions during your hike. Have the courage to turn back if you feel it is dangerous.
- **Beware of Asiatic Black Bears**:
    - Asiatic black bears inhabit Mt. Chokai. Avoid hiking alone, and make your presence known with a bear bell or radio.
