# Rules and Precautions Specific to Mt. Chokai

## Overview
Mt. Chokai is an active volcano and has a unique environment different from other mountains, such as snowy valleys that remain even in summer. To enjoy hiking safely, please pay special attention to the following points.

## Mt. Chokai-Specific Precautions
- **Helmet Use is Recommended**:
    - The area near the summit, especially around Shinzan peak, is a brittle rock face formed by volcanic activity. Due to the constant risk of falling rocks, wearing a helmet is strongly recommended.
- **Walking on Snowy Valleys (Sekkei)**:
    - Until around July, many courses, such as the Senjadani and Shinji valleys, have sections that require walking on snow.
    - To cross these snowy valleys, **light crampons (4 or 6-point) are essential** for traction. Walking with sneakers or rain boots is extremely dangerous.
    - It is easy to get lost in poor visibility, so never push yourself beyond your limits.
- **Bring a Portable Toilet**:
    - The number of toilets on Mt. Chokai is limited, and the toilet at the Mihama Hut is currently closed. To protect the natural environment, **please be sure to bring a portable toilet** and carry out any used ones responsibly.
- **Regarding Drone Use**:
    - Flying a drone within the Quasi-National Park requires prior application to the Tohoku Regional Environment Office. Unauthorized flights are not permitted.
