# Rules for Nature Conservation

## Overview
Mt. Chokai is a "natural treasury" where many precious plants and animals live. The cooperation of every hiker is essential to preserve this wonderful nature for future generations.

## Specific Rules
- **Stay on the Trail**:
    - Walking off the trail can trample the delicate alpine plants underfoot and cause destruction to the vegetation. In particular, never step off the wooden boardwalks in the wetlands.
- **Do Not Take or Introduce Flora and Fauna**:
    - You must not collect alpine plants, mushrooms, insects, or other wildlife you find on the mountain. Also, be careful not to drop seeds of plants brought from other areas to protect the local ecosystem.
- **Do Not Feed Wildlife**:
    - Feeding wild animals can cause them to lose their fear of humans and disrupt the balance of the ecosystem. No matter how cute they are, never feed them.
- **Use Protective Caps on Trekking Poles**:
    - If the tips of your trekking poles are metal, they will damage the trails and wooden boardwalks. To protect the vegetation, please be sure to use them with rubber caps attached.
