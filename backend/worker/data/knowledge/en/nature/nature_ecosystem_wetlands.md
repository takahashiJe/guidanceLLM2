# Wetlands and Springs of Mt. Chokai

## Overview
The abundant snowmelt from Mt. Chokai forms many wetlands and spring areas at the foot of the mountain. These places are habitats for precious flora and fauna that prefer clean, waterside environments.

## Representative Wetlands and Springs
- **Shishigabana Wetland**:
    - A wetland formed by the spring water of Mt. Chokai, it is a fantastical place where mosses, including the globally rare "Chokai Marimo," spread out like a carpet.
- **Ryugahara Wetland (Haraikawa)**:
    - This wetland spreads out at the 5th station of the Yashima trailhead. **In July, the beautiful purple flowers of Hiougi-ayame (Iris setosa) are in full bloom**. Additionally, the spherical algae **"Chokai Marimo"** grows in the clear streams that flow here, symbolizing the blessings of Mt. Chokai's abundant snowmelt.
- **Oshizu Wetland**:
    - Located at the 4th station of the Momoyake course, where you can see colonies of Mizubasho (Asian skunk-cabbage) and Kobai-keiso (Veratrum stamineum) in the summer.
- **Motodaki Fukuryusui (Underflow Water)**:
    - A representative spring spot of Mt. Chokai, where water gushes out from all over a moss-covered rock face.

## Nurtured Ecosystem
These wetlands and spring areas are home to freshwater fish like the "Ibara-tomiyo" (a type of stickleback) that can only survive in clear streams, as well as amphibians like salamanders, forming a unique and rich ecosystem nurtured by Mt. Chokai's water circulation system.
