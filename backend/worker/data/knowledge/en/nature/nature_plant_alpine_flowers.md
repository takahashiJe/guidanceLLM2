# The Flower Fields of Mt. Chokai

## Overview
Known as one of "Japan's 100 Famous Flower Mountains," Mt. Chokai features widespread "flower fields" of alpine plants, especially in summer. The abundant water from melting snow nurtures a variety of colorful flowers.

## Representative Flower Fields and Flowers
- **Around Lake Chokai and Mihama**:
    - The Mihama area at the 7th station, where the Kisakata and Fukura trailheads merge, is one of the largest flower fields on the mountain.
    - **Main Flowers**: Large colonies of Nikko-kisuge (yellow), Hakusan-ichige (white), Chinguruma (white), and Iwa-icho (white) can be found.
- **Senjogahara**:
    - A vast snow-patch meadow located between the Takinokoya and Yunodai courses.
    - **Main Flowers**: With the snowmelt, Kobai-keiso (white) and Miyama-kinpoge (yellow) begin to bloom all at once.
- **Around Mt. Shogatake**:
    - Colonies of Ao-no-tsugazakura (pale green) and Iwa-kagami (pink) can be seen.

## Season
The best time to see the flower fields varies depending on the location and the amount of remaining snow that year, but the peak is generally from early July to mid-August.
