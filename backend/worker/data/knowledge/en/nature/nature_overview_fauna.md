# Overall Charm of Mt. Chokai's Fauna

## Overview
Supported by its diverse natural environment, Mt. Chokai is a habitat for a vast array of animals, from rare birds of prey to small insects. In particular, the presence of the golden eagle, which stands at the top of the ecosystem, and the specially protected Japanese serow, is the best evidence of the health and richness of Mt. Chokai's nature.

## Main Inhabiting Animals
- **Mammals**: More than 21 species have been confirmed, including the Japanese serow (a Special Natural Monument of Japan), the Japanese dormouse (a Natural Monument), the red fox, the Japanese squirrel, and the stoat. The presence of the Asiatic black bear has also been confirmed, so caution is necessary when hiking.
- **Birds**: Over 124 species of birds have been confirmed between Mt. Chokai and the offshore island of Tobishima. Various birds can be observed at different altitudes, such as the alpine accentor and Japanese accentor near the summit, the golden eagle at the foothills, and the Japanese cormorant on the coast.
- **Insects & Amphibians**: Precious insects are also found here, including the alpine butterfly Erebia niphonica, said to be a relic of the ice age, and the Gifu butterfly (Luehdorfia japonica). The Meisho-numa Pond on Mt. Koshiki and the area around Tsurumaike Pond are also known as large-scale spawning sites for the forest green tree frog.
- **Fish**: The abundant springs at the foot of the mountain are home to freshwater fish that prefer clear streams, such as the Ibara-tomiyo (a type of stickleback). Salmon runs can also be seen in the rivers.
