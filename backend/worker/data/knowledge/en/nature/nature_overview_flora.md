# Overall Charm of Mt. Chokai's Flora

## Overview
Mt. Chokai is so famous for its diverse plant life that it is selected as one of "Japan's 100 Famous Flower Mountains." Its unique environment, being close to the Sea of Japan with heavy winter snowfall, nurtures a rich vegetation not found on other mountains.

## Characteristics of the Vegetation
- **Alpine Plants at Low Altitudes**: Alpine plants typically found in the 2,000-meter class can be seen from around 1,000 meters on Mt. Chokai. This is due to the abundant snowmelt and the cool climate even in summer.
- **Condensed Vertical Distribution**: Starting with the vast beech forests at the foot of the mountain, diverse vegetation zones—wetlands, flower fields, and the volcanic desert at the summit—are condensed into a short distance as the altitude increases. The near absence of a coniferous forest zone is a major characteristic unique to this heavy-snow region.
- **A Treasure Trove of Endemic Species**: Many precious endemic and special-variant species, such as "Chokai-fusuma" and "Chokai-azami," which bear the mountain's name, grow wild here and can be seen nowhere else.

## Main Vegetation Zones
- **Montane Zone (Foothills and up)**: Broad-leaved forests, mainly of beech and Mizunara oak, spread out.
- **Subalpine Zone**: Erman's birch and Sasa bamboo can be seen.
- **Alpine Zone (Near the summit)**: Wind-beaten grasslands and snow-patch grasslands have developed, where dwarf shrubs and alpine plants adapted to the harsh environment grow.
