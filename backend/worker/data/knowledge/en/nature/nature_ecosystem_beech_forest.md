# The Primeval Beech Forest of Mt. Chokai

## Overview
From the foothills to the mid-slopes of Mt. Chokai, a vast primeval beech forest, largely untouched by human hands, extends. This rich forest is the foundation that supports the diverse ecosystem of Mt. Chokai.

## Characteristics
- **Water Retention Function**: The soil of the beech forest has a high capacity to store water like a sponge, earning it the name "green dam." The snowmelt and rainwater stored here are filtered over many years, becoming the source of the abundant springs at the foot of the mountain.
- **Diverse Flora and Fauna**: The beech forest is a cradle of life, nurturing everything from large mammals like the Japanese serow and Asiatic black bear to mushrooms, wild vegetables, and insects.
- **Beautiful Scenery**: It displays beautiful scenery throughout the seasons: fresh green in spring, deep green in summer, yellow foliage in autumn, and snowy landscapes in winter. In particular, the giant beech trees of Nakadai, represented by the "Agariko Daio," overwhelm visitors with their vitality.

## Main Beech Forest Areas
- **Nakadai Recreation Forest**: Home to the "Agariko Daio," with well-maintained walking paths.
- **Around Momoyake and Sarukura Trailheads**: Features beech forests that are closer to their primeval state.
