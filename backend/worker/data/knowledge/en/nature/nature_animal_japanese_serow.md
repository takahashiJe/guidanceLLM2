# Japanese Serow

## Overview
The Japanese serow is an endemic species of Japan that, despite being in the Bovidae family, is adept at navigating steep, rocky terrain like a goat. It is designated as a Special Natural Monument of Japan, and on Mt. Chokai, it is one of the animals that hikers have a relatively high chance of encountering.

## Ecology and Characteristics
- **Appearance**: Despite the Japanese expression "legs like a serow" (implying slender legs), they actually have thick, sturdy legs. Both males and females have short horns.
- **Habitat**: They inhabit a wide area of Mt. Chokai, from the beech forests at the foothills to the rocky areas of the alpine zone.
- **Docile Personality**: They generally have a gentle nature and may just stand and stare at you. If you encounter one unexpectedly while hiking, do not panic; either quietly move away or wait for it to pass.

## Sightings on Mt. Chokai
They are sometimes spotted on the roadside of the Chokai Blue Line or along hiking trails. Encounters are most likely in the early morning or evening. Their presence is another symbol of the rich nature of Mt. Chokai.
