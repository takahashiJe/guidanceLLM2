# Golden Eagle

## Overview
Mt. Chokai is known as one of the few habitats for the golden eagle in Japan. The golden eagle is a large bird of prey that reigns at the top of the ecosystem, and its existence is a symbol of how rich and healthy the natural environment of Mt. Chokai is.

## Habitat Status on Mt. Chokai
- **Pair Confirmation**: The habitation of breeding pairs has been confirmed on both the Yamagata and Akita prefecture sides of the mountain.
- **Vast Home Range**: Golden eagles require a very large home range. Their ability to live here means that there is an abundance of small animals (like the Japanese hare) for prey, suitable cliffs for nesting, and open environments for hunting.
- **Observation Opportunities**: They are extremely wary, so sightings are rare, but if you are lucky, you may witness them soaring majestically in the sky near the summit.

## Conservation Efforts
The golden eagle is an endangered species, and research and conservation activities are ongoing to protect its habitat. Hikers are asked to watch over them quietly so as not to threaten their living environment.
