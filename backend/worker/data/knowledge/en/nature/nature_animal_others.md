# Other Characteristic Animals

## Overview
In addition to the golden eagle and the Japanese serow, Mt. Chokai is home to many other noteworthy and precious animals.

## Main Animals
- **Stoat (Okojo)**:
    - A member of the weasel family, its coat is brown on the back and white on the belly in summer, and turns completely white in winter. It is sometimes called the "fairy of the mountains" for its adorable appearance, but it is a fierce hunter that preys on mice and other small animals.
- **Japanese Dormouse (Yamane)**:
    - A small, nocturnal, mouse-like animal designated as a Natural Monument of Japan. It is skilled at living in trees and hibernates in tree hollows during the winter.
- **Erebia niphonica**:
    - A species of alpine butterfly considered to be a relic of the ice age. It can be seen around the flower fields at high altitudes.
- **Forest Green Tree Frog (Mori-aogaeru)**:
    - A frog with the unusual habit of laying its foamy egg masses on tree branches overhanging ponds and swamps. On Mt. Chokai, the Meisho-numa Pond on Mt. Koshiki and the area around Tsurumaike Pond are famous as its breeding grounds.
