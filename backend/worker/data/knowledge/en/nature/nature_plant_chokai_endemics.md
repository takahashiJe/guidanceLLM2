# Endemic Plants of Mt. Chokai

## Overview
Mt. Chokai is home to extremely precious endemic and special-variant species that can only be found in this region of the world, such as "Chokai-fusuma" and "Chokai-azami," which bear the mountain's name. These are plants that have evolved uniquely while adapting to the harsh natural environment of Mt. Chokai.

## Representative Endemic and Special-Variant Species
- **Chokai-fusuma (Arenaria merckioides var. chokaiensis)**
    - A member of the Caryophyllaceae family, it takes root in harsh environments where other plants find it difficult to grow, such as the sandy and gravelly areas near the summit, and blooms with lovely white flowers in summer.
- **Chokai-azami (Cirsium chokaiense)**
    - A member of the Asteraceae family, the thistle of Mt. Chokai is considered to be this endemic species. It blooms with vibrant purple flowers from summer to autumn.
- **Chokai-chinguruma (Sieversia pentapetala var. chokaiensis)**
    - Considered a variety of the Rosaceae family's Sieversia pentapetala, it is particularly common on Mt. Chokai. It grows in clusters in moist places, such as near snowy valleys, and is characterized by its white flowers and the cotton-like seed heads that follow.

Walking while searching for these plants is one of the great pleasures of climbing Mt. Chokai.
