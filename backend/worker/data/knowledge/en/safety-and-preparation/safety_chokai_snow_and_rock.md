# Navigating Mt. Chokai's Snowfields and Rocky Terrains

## Overview
In the alpine zone of Mt. Chokai, there are two particularly hazardous areas: "snowfields" (sekkei), where snow remains even in summer, and brittle "rocky terrain," formed by volcanic activity. Each requires specific equipment and caution.

##対策 for Snowfields (Sekkei)
- **Risks**: The snow that lingers into the summer can be hard and icy on the surface, posing a very high risk of slipping and falling. Large snowfields remain in places like the Senjadani Valley, Shinji Sekkei, and the Koshin-do trail.
- **Essential Gear**:
    - **Light Crampons**: These are anti-slip devices attached to the soles of your boots. Six-point crampons or more are recommended. Never attempt to walk on snowfields in sneakers or rain boots.
    - **Ice Axe**: An ice axe provides security on steep snow slopes and can be used to self-arrest in case of a fall.
- **Precautions**: In foggy conditions with poor visibility, it is easy to become disoriented on a snowfield. This can lead to getting lost, so avoid crossing snowfields in bad weather.

##対策 for Rocky Terrain (Near the Summit)
- **Risks**: The area around the new peak, Shinzan, is a lava dome formed by the 1801 eruption. It is an extremely brittle and unstable place made of piled-up rocks. There is a danger of causing a rockfall yourself or being hit by one caused by others.
- **Recommended Gear**:
    - **Helmet**: Wearing a helmet is strongly recommended to protect your head from falling rocks.
- **Precautions**:
    - Be careful not to place your hands or feet on loose rocks. Climb cautiously using **three points of contact** (supporting your body with three of your four limbs at all times).
    - If there are other climbers below you and you dislodge a rock, shout **"ROCK!"** loudly to warn them of the danger.
