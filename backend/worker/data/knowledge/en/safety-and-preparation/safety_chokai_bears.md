# How to Deal with Asiatic Black Bears

## Overview
Mt. Chokai is home to Asiatic black bears. A sudden encounter can lead to a serious accident, so it is crucial to take thorough preventive measures to avoid meeting a bear.

## To Avoid Encountering a Bear
- **Announce Your Presence with Sound**:
    - Carry a **bear bell** or a radio and make noise as you walk. Bears have excellent hearing and will usually avoid humans if they are aware of their presence.
    - Occasionally clapping your hands or shouting out loud is also effective.
- **Be Cautious at Dawn and Dusk**:
    - Bears tend to be most active in the early morning and at twilight. Be especially careful during these times.
- **Avoid Hiking Alone**:
    - Hiking in a group and talking amongst yourselves naturally announces your presence.
- **Manage Food Properly**:
    - The smell of food in your backpack can attract bears. Use airtight containers to minimize odors.
    - Never leave garbage or leftover food in the mountains, as this can attract bears to human areas.

## If You Encounter a Bear
1.  **Don't Panic, Don't Shout**: Shouting or running away (showing your back) can provoke the bear.
2.  **Back Away Slowly**: Keep your eyes on the bear and retreat slowly and quietly.
3.  **If Attacked**: In the unlikely event of an attack, lie face down on the ground, cover the back of your neck with both hands, and protect your vital areas.
