# Emergency Response

## Overview
Even with thorough preparation, unexpected situations can occur in the mountains. It is crucial to know how to act in an emergency, whether you are lost, injured, or facing a sudden change in weather.

## Emergency Contacts
- **Police**: Dial 110
    - If you are lost or unable to move, do not hesitate to call the police (110) to request a rescue.
- **Mountain Huts**:
    - If you can contact a staffed hut during the season (such as the Chokaisan Summit Hut or **Takinokoya Hut**), report your situation and follow their instructions.

## If You Get Lost
1.  **Stay Calm**: First, do not panic. Try to ascertain your current location.
2.  **Turn Back**: If you feel you have taken a wrong turn, the golden rule is to return to the last known point on the trail.
3.  **Stay Put**: If returning is difficult, do not wander around aimlessly. Wait for rescue where you are. Conserving energy is the top priority.
4.  **Make Contact**: If you have a cell signal, contact the police and accurately report your location, situation, and the number of people in your party.

## If the Volcanic Alert Level is Raised
- **Descend Promptly**: If the volcanic alert level is raised while you are hiking, descend immediately using the designated route.
- **Go to a Shelter**: If you cannot descend right away, take refuge in the nearest mountain hut or emergency shelter and await information. Wear a helmet to protect yourself from falling volcanic rocks.

## Local Rescue System
The municipalities around Mt. Chokai have organized rescue teams composed of local mountaineering club members. These teams work in cooperation with the police and fire departments to conduct rescue operations.
