# Essential Climbing Gear Guide

## Overview
To ensure a safe climb, preparing the right gear is essential. This guide introduces the most basic equipment needed for a day hike.

## The "Three Essentials" of Climbing
These items are lifelines for safe climbing and must be carried at all times.
1.  **Rainwear**:
    - Choose a waterproof, breathable, two-piece (top and bottom) set. It's crucial not only for protection against rain but also as a windbreaker for warmth.
2.  **Topographic Map**:
    - While smartphone GPS apps are useful, always carry a physical paper map in case of device failure or dead batteries.
3.  **Compass**:
    - Used in conjunction with a map, a compass allows you to confirm your current location and the direction you need to go.

## Must-Have Items
- **Backpack**: For a day trip, a capacity of 20-30 liters is recommended.
- **Hiking Boots**: Choose boots that protect your ankles and have non-slip soles.
- **Headlamp**: Essential even for day hikes in case of unexpected delays in your descent.
- **Food & Emergency Rations**: Pack easy-to-eat snacks for energy and emergency food just in case.
- **Water**: Depending on the season and trail, about 1-2 liters.
- **Warm Clothing**: A fleece or down jacket. Mountain temperatures are lower than at sea level, and this is necessary to prepare for sudden weather changes.
- **Hat, Gloves, Sunglasses**: To protect yourself from sun, cold, and injuries.
- **First-Aid Kit**: Include items like bandages and disinfectant.
- **Mobile Phone & Power Bank**: As a means of communication in an emergency.

## The Basics of "Layering"
The fundamental principle is to wear three layers: a "base layer" (underwear), a "mid layer" (insulating layer), and an "outer layer" (shell). By frequently adjusting your body temperature—such as removing the mid layer when you sweat—you can prevent getting chilled from sweat and avoid heatstroke.
