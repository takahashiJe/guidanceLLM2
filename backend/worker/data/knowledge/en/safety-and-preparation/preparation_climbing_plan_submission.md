# Submitting a Climbing Plan

## What is a Climbing Plan?
A Climbing Plan (or Itinerary) is a document that outlines "who" will climb "when," "which mountain," and "via which route." Submitting this plan allows rescue teams, such as the police, to conduct swift and accurate search and rescue operations in the unfortunate event you get lost.

## Why is Submission Necessary?
- **A Lifesaving Compass**: Your climbing plan is your "lifesaving compass." In an emergency, rescue teams rely on this information to estimate your location and begin their search. Without it, finding you in the vastness of the mountains becomes extremely difficult.
- **For Yourself and Your Family**: Submitting a plan not only raises your own safety awareness but also provides peace of mind to family and friends who are waiting for your safe return.

## How to Submit
1.  **Drop it in a Postbox at the Trailhead**:
    - At the main trailheads of Mt. Chokai (such as **Hokodate** and **Haraikawa**), there are postboxes for submitting your climbing plan. Prepare the form in advance, fill it out, and drop it in.
2.  **Submit Online**:
    - You can also submit your plan in advance online using websites or apps like "Compass - Mountain and Nature Network."
3.  **Submit to a Police Station**:
    - It is also possible to submit the plan directly, or by mail or fax, to the police station that has jurisdiction over the trailhead.

**The phrase "climbing is at your own risk" begins with the submission of this climbing plan. Always be sure to submit it.**
