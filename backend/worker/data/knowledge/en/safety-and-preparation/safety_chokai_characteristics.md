# Characteristics and Risks of Mt. Chokai

## Overview
Behind its beautiful appearance, Mt. Chokai presents several risks stemming from its unique natural environment. Understanding these in advance is key to a safe climb.

## Main Characteristics and Risks
- **Sudden Weather Changes**:
    - As an isolated peak facing the Sea of Japan, Mt. Chokai is directly hit by moist air from the sea, making its weather extremely unpredictable. It is common for clear skies to suddenly become enveloped in thick fog (gas), or to be hit by strong winds and rain. Always carry rainwear and warm clothing, and pay close attention to changes in the weather.
- **It is an Active Volcano**:
    - Mt. Chokai is an "active volcano" that continues to be monitored. The most recent eruption was in 1974, and volcanic activity could occur in the future.
    - Before climbing, always check the latest **Volcanic Alert Level** issued by the Japan Meteorological Agency. If the level is raised, you must follow instructions, which may include canceling your climb.
- **Volcanic Gas**:
    - In some areas, such as around the crater near the summit, there may be emissions of volcanic gas (like hydrogen sulfide). If you notice a peculiar smell, do not linger and leave the area promptly.

Understanding and preparing for these risks is the first step to safely enjoying Mt. Chokai.
