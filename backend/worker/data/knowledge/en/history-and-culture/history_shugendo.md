# Mountain Worship and Shugendo on Mt. Chokai

## Overview
Since ancient times, Mt. Chokai has been a sacred mountain where the deity "Omonoimi-no-kami" resides, making it an important object of faith for praying for national peace. Since the Middle Ages, it has also flourished as a sacred site for "Shugendo," a practice of rigorous training in the mountains, and has nurtured its own unique culture.

## History of Faith
- **Ancient State Rituals**: The "Chokaisan Omonoimi Shrine," with its main shrine at the summit and satellite shrines (Kuchinomiya) at the foot in Fukura and Waraoka, received deep reverence from the imperial court as the Ichinomiya (highest-ranked shrine) of Dewa Province.
- **Development of Chokai Shugen**: In the Middle Ages, practitioners of Shugendo, founded by En no Gyoja, used Mt. Chokai as a training ground. In particular, a Shugendo community with thirty-three lodges was formed at the Waraoka trailhead, becoming a base for many Yamabushi (mountain ascetics).
- **Prosperity of Pilgrimage Groups**: During the Edo period, "tohai" (pilgrimages to the summit) by groups of ordinary people called "ko" became popular.
- **Faith Today**: Although Shugendo temporarily declined due to the Meiji era's separation of Shinto and Buddhism, the faith of giving thanks for the mountain's blessings and praying for good harvests and safety is still strongly inherited in the festivals and folk arts at the foot of the mountain.

## What is Shugendo?
It is an ancient Japanese religion that aims to attain enlightenment through rigorous training in the mountains, with natural objects (especially mountains) as objects of worship. It was formed through a fusion of Buddhism, Taoism, and Shinto.
