# The Story Behind the Jyuroku Rakan Iwa Rocks

## Overview
The "Jyuroku Rakan Iwa," 22 Buddhist figures carved into the rock face along the coast of Yuza Town, were created through the strong wish of a single Buddhist priest.

## The Reason for Their Creation
During the late Edo and early Meiji periods, Kankai, a priest at Kaizen-ji Temple in Fukura, was grieved by the great number of fishermen who lost their lives in the rough seas of the Sea of Japan.

Therefore, to pray for the souls of those who died in maritime accidents and for the future safety of fishermen, he decided to carve Buddhist statues into the rocks. Together with local stonemasons, he spent five years from 1864 to complete these 22 statues.

## Legacy to the Present Day
The priest's wish is still carried on by the local people today. Every summer, the "Jyuroku Rakan Festival" is held, where maritime safety is prayed for along with a fireworks display. The history of the earnest prayers of people who lived with the harshness of nature is carved here.
