# Kisakata and Matsuo Basho

## Overview
While present-day Kisakata is a vast area of rice paddies, until the Edo period, it was a lagoon dotted with countless small islands formed by the collapse of Mt. Chokai. Its scenic beauty was so renowned it was known as a poetic theme (utamakura) even in the capital.

## Basho's Visit
The haiku poet Matsuo Basho, longing to see the scenery of Kisakata, visited this place as the northernmost destination of his journey for "Oku no Hosomichi" (The Narrow Road to the Deep North). However, the day Basho visited was unfortunately rainy, and viewing the islands shrouded in mist, he composed a poem: "Matsushima is like a smile, Kisakata is like a grudge" (meaning, while the scenery of Matsushima is cheerful and brilliant, Kisakata's is beautiful with a touch of sorrow).

## Topographical Change
In 1804, about 100 years after Basho's visit, the Kisakata earthquake caused the land to rise by about 2 meters, and the water in the lagoon drained into the sea. This transformed the former "islands" into the current landscape of small hills scattered among rice fields. This topographical change itself is a living geo-site, closely related to the volcanic activity of Mt. Chokai.
