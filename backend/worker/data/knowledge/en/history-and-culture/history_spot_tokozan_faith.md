# The Faith of Mt. Toko

## Overview
Mt. Toko, located near the city center of Yurihonjo, is not just a hiking course but a sacred mountain where ancient faith is still alive.

## The Training Ground of Priest Zesan
Mt. Toko is known as the place where Priest Zesan, the founder of Chokoku-ji Temple at its foot, secluded himself for rigorous ascetic training. For this reason, it has been cherished by local people as a sacred mountain.

## The "Gohozan" Faith
Furthermore, Mt. Toko, along with neighboring mountains such as Mt. Kuromori, Mt. Butsudo, and Mt. Sasamori, was collectively known as "Gohozan" (The Five Peaks) and worshipped as a single entity. This demonstrates an ancient form of Japanese mountain worship where not just one mountain, but a whole range of mountains, is considered a sacred place.

## Bishamon-do Hall
At the 5th station of the hiking trail is the Bishamon-do Hall, which has long served as a center of faith and an important landmark on the trail.
