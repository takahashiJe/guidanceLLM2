# Volcanic History of Mt. Chokai

## Overview
Mt. Chokai is a stratovolcano formed over a long period of about 600,000 years of volcanic activity. Its history is marked by extremely dynamic events, from large-scale sector collapses that significantly altered the mountain's shape to more recent phreatic eruptions.

## Major Volcanic History
- **Around 466 BC**: A large-scale sector collapse occurred. The massive amount of debris from this event reached the Sea of Japan, forming the original "Kisakata" lagoon with its many small islands (megablocks).
- **871 (Jogan 13)**: A large-scale eruption with lava flows occurred. This eruption is recorded in historical texts such as the "Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku."
- **1800-1801 (Kyowa era)**: A phreatomagmatic explosion took place, forming the current summit, the "Shinzan" lava dome. This eruption also caused volcanic mudflows (lahars), which damaged the foothills.
- **1974 (Showa 49)**: The first phreatic eruption in about 150 years occurred. Plumes of smoke rose from a crater on the eastern slope, and small mudflows were also observed. This event is known as the "Showa Eruption."

## Connection to the Geopark
Mt. Chokai and its surrounding area have been designated as the "Mount Chokai and Tobishima Island Geopark" in recognition of this dynamic volcanic history, the unique topography and geology it created, its ecosystem, and the culture of its people. Through hiking and sightseeing, you can experience the traces of the Earth's activity up close.
