# Legends of Mt. Yashio

## Overview
Although Mt. Yashio is popular as a place for family hiking, its name and locations reveal remnants of several local legends and beliefs.

## The Legend of the Kizakura
On Mt. Yashio, "Kizakura" (yellow cherry blossoms) bloom in spring. Various legends related to this area have been passed down about these rare cherry blossoms, and many people visit in mid-May when they are in full bloom. The name of the hot spring facility at the foot of the mountain, "Kizakura Onsen Yurari," also originates from this legend.

## Torii no Sawa Trailhead
One of the trailheads in the Yashio Ikoi no Mori forest park is called "Torii no Sawa Trailhead" (The Torii Gate Stream Trailhead). This is believed to originate from the fact that the path along this stream was once an important approach to Yashio Shrine at the summit of Mt. Yashio, and a torii gate was built there. The name of the trailhead itself shows that this mountain was an object of faith for the local people.
