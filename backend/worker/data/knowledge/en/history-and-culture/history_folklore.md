# Legends and Folktales of Mt. Chokai

## Overview
Numerous legends and folktales, born from the majestic nature, unique terrain, and people's faith, have been passed down in Mt. Chokai and its surrounding areas.

## Major Legends and Folktales
- **The Legend of Tenaga-Ashinaga**:
    - A yokai (monster) named "Tenaga-Ashinaga" (Long Arms, Long Legs) lived on Mt. Chokai, causing mischief to travelers and catching all the fish in the Sea of Japan. To defeat this monster, a sacred three-legged crow, sent by the god of Mt. Chokai, is said to have revealed the yokai's location by crying "Uya, muya." This cry is believed to be the origin of the Japanese phrase "uyamuya," which means something is ambiguous or uncertain.
- **The Origin Legend of Tobishima Island**:
    - A dynamic legend that says when Mt. Chokai erupted, its summit was blown off, fell into the Sea of Japan, and became "Tobishima Island" (Flying Island). This legend illustrates the intensity of Mt. Chokai's volcanic activity.
- **The Legend of Kobo Daishi (Kukai)**:
    - Many legends remain on the eastern side of the mountain, such as at Hottai Waterfall, Tamada Valley, and the Momoyake trailhead, telling of the great monk Kobo Daishi's ascetic training. These stories of enduring severe training in the harsh nature are tied to the history of Shugendo (mountain asceticism).

## Background of the Legends
These legends are an expression of the awe people held for the nature of Mt. Chokai and their attempts to understand natural phenomena like volcanic activity. They also represent the prayers of the people for regional safety and prosperity, passed down in the form of stories.
