# Hottai Waterfall and the Legend of Kobo Daishi

## Overview
The famous "Hottai Waterfall," selected as one of "Japan's Top 100 Waterfalls," and its surrounding area are known as a place where many legends related to the great Heian period monk Kobo Daishi (Kukai) remain.

## Kobo-daira
"Kobo-daira," located at the entrance of the Hottai Waterfall and Tamada Valley course, is, as its name suggests, said to be the place where Kobo Daishi underwent rigorous ascetic training. It has a history as a starting point for Shugendo practitioners who ventured into the valley.

## The Place Name "Momoyake"
This entire area is called "Momoyake," and many stories related to Kobo Daishi also remain here. The legend of his severe training in the rugged nature tells that Mt. Chokai has been a sacred site for Shugendo since ancient times.
