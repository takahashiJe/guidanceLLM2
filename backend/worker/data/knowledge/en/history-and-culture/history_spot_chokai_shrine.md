# History and Faith of Chokaisan Omonoimi Shrine

## Overview
The Chokaisan Omonoimi Shrine has its main shrine (Honsha) at the summit, and two satellite shrines called "Kuchinomiya" at the foot of the mountain in Fukura and Waraoka. In ancient times, it received special status from the state as the "Ichinomiya" (highest-ranked shrine) of Dewa Province and has been the center of Mt. Chokai worship.

## Centers of Worship
- **Summit Main Shrine (Honsha)**: Enshrined at the summit of Mt. Chokai (Shinzan), it worships the deity Omonoimi-no-kami. It is open only during the summer climbing season and is visited by many pilgrims.
- **Fukura Kuchinomiya**: Located in Fukura, Yuza Town, Yamagata Prefecture, it enshrines the deities Ukanomitama-no-mikoto and Toyoukehime-no-kami. It is the base for the ancient pilgrimage route from the Fukura side.
- **Waraoka Kuchinomiya**: Also in Waraoka, Yuza Town, it enshrines Ukanomitama-no-mikoto and Tsukuyomi-no-mikoto. It is the center of the Waraoka settlement, which once flourished as a major hub of Chokai Shugendo.

## Historical Significance
This three-shrine-in-one format conveys the old form of Japanese mountain worship, where the mountain itself is considered a god and is worshipped from bases at its foot. It has a history of attracting faith at a national level, such as the summit and foothill shrines performing state rituals in alternate years, and is an important component of the designated National Historic Site.
