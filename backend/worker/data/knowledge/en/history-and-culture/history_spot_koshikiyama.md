# History and Origin of Mt. Koshiki's Name

## Overview
Mt. Koshiki, located to the east of Mt. Chokai, is a distinctive mountain consisting of a pair of stone peaks, "Okoshiki" (male peak) and "Mekoshiki" (female peak). Its name has an origin related to the lives of people from long ago.

## Origin of the Place Name
A "koshiki" is a wooden tub (steamer) with holes in the bottom, used for steaming rice and other grains. It is said that Mt. Koshiki was given this name because its shape resembles that of a "koshiki." This reveals the unique sensibility of ancient people, who likened the shape of a mountain to a tool used in daily life.

## Faith and Legends
As can be understood from the names likening them to a man and a woman—Okoshiki and Mekoshiki—these peaks have been objects of worship since ancient times. A small shrine is enshrined at the summit, and the surrounding area is dotted with spots where nature and faith are integrated, such as "Meisho-numa Pond," where the forest green tree frog lives.
