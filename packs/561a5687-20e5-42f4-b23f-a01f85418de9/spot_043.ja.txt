Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the tour guide about the 花立クリーンハイツ. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the structure: intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so about 200-300 words. Use the correct proper nouns, avoid excessive metaphors. Also, include a safety note about weather, footing, and wildlife, without recommending excessive activities.

The facts given are that it's a tourist facility in 鳥海高原, has a restaurant, info corner, check-in for adjacent cottages, and the popular Jersey soft cream. 

Intro: Start with welcoming visitors to the area and introducing the spot. Mention it's a base facility. 

Key facts: Location, amenities like restaurant and info corner, check-in for cottages, and the soft cream. 

Fun tidbit: The Jersey soft cream is a must-try. 

Safety: Weather, footing, and wildlife. Maybe mention checking weather forecasts, being cautious on trails, and keeping a distance from wildlife.

Wait, the safety reminder needs to be a single sentence. So perhaps: "天候や足元、野生動物への注意を忘れず、安全に楽しんでください。" 

Check if all the constraints are met. No speculation, self-contained, no references to documents. Use plain text only. Avoid overusing metaphors. Make sure the proper nouns are correct. 

Let me draft the narration now, keeping each section concise. Make sure the total is around 200-300 words. Let me count the words. 

Intro: 1-2 sentences. Key facts: 2-3 sentences. Fun tidbit: 1 sentence. Safety: 1 sentence. That should fit. 

Double-check for any speculation. The facts are given, so no need to add extra info. Safety note is straightforward. 

Okay, time to put it all together in Japanese, ensuring the structure and constraints are met.
