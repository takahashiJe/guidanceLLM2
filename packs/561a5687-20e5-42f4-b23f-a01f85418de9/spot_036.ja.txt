Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the tour guide in Japanese about the 鳥海高原花立牧場公園. Let me start by understanding the user's requirements.

First, the structure needs to be four parts: short intro, key facts/history/nature, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so about 200-300 characters. I have to avoid overusing metaphors and keep it self-contained without referencing any documents.

The facts given are that it's a leisure spot in the north麓 of 鳥海山, centered around a Jersey cow farm, with go-karts, park golf, and an animal interaction area for families. The safety reminder should mention weather, footing, and wildlife, without recommending excessive activities.

Let me start with the intro. Maybe something like "鳥海高原花立牧場公園は、鳥海山の北麓に広がるレジャースポットです。" That's the first part.

Next, key facts: mention the Jersey cows, the various attractions like go-karts and park golf, and that it's family-friendly. Need to keep it concise. Maybe "ジャージー牛の牧場を中心に、ゴーカートやパークゴルフ、動物とのふれあい広場などがあり、家族で一日中楽しめます。"

Fun tidbit: Maybe a unique fact, like the cows being a highlight or something about the area. Since the user said to avoid speculation, maybe just mention the animals as a highlight. "特にジャージー牛とのふれあいは、子供たちに人気です。"

Safety reminder: Weather, footing, wildlife. "天候や足元の確認、野生動物への配慮を忘れずに。" That's straightforward.

Now check the constraints. Avoid overused metaphors. Use proper names correctly. Keep it self-contained. No markdown, plain text. Let me put it all together.

Wait, the safety part needs to be a sentence. Maybe combine the last parts. Also, check the character count. Let me count the characters. The example response is around 200-300 characters. Let me make sure each part is covered and the structure is correct.
