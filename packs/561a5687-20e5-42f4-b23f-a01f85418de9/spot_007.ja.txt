Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the spot 法体の滝 (ID: spot_007) as a tour guide. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the structure should be: short intro, key facts/history/nature, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, which is about 200-300 characters. I need to avoid excessive metaphors and keep it self-contained without referencing any documents.

The facts given are that it's part of the Japanese 100 Waterfalls selection, water from Chokai Mountain flows in three steps. The fun tidbit could be something like the name meaning "lawful body waterfall" or a local story. For safety, mention weather, footing, and wildlife, but without recommending excessive actions.

Let me check the constraints again. No speculation, so if I don't know something, I should say so briefly. The safety reminder needs to include weather, footing, and wildlife. Also, avoid over-the-top recommendations.

So, the intro should introduce the waterfall. Then mention it's in the 100 Waterfalls list, the three-tier flow. The fun tidbit could be the name's origin. Safety: check weather, watch your step, be cautious of wildlife. Keep it concise.

Wait, the user specified to avoid over-the-top metaphors. So I need to stick to factual descriptions. Also, make sure the name is correct. The name 法体の滝 – maybe "hōtei no taki" – I should confirm the correct pronunciation, but since it's in the facts, maybe the name is correct as given.

Putting it all together: Start with a welcoming statement, mention the waterfall's status, describe the three-tier flow. Then a fun fact about the name. Safety: check weather, watch footing, be aware of wildlife. Keep each part concise. Let me count the characters to ensure it's within the limit. Maybe around 250 characters. Let me draft it now.
