Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically about 花立クリーンハイツ. The facts provided mention it's a tourist facility with a restaurant, info corner, and check-in for cottages, plus the popular Jersey soft cream.

First, I need to structure the narration as per the constraints: intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone should be calm and informative, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. Avoid overused metaphors and keep it self-contained.

Starting with the intro: "訪問者の皆様、花立クリーンハイツへようこそ。" That's a good opening. Next, key facts: mention it's a base for tourism, the restaurant, info corner, check-in for cottages, and the soft cream. Need to keep it concise.

Fun tidbit: Maybe the Jersey soft cream is a local favorite, so highlight that. Safety reminder: Weather, footing, wildlife. Since the area might have unpredictable weather and uneven paths, advise checking conditions. Also, mention wildlife like bears, so visitors should be cautious.

Check if all points are covered without speculation. The user said to avoid unknowns, so if there's any uncertainty, just state it briefly. Since the facts are given, no need to add extra info. Make sure to use the correct names and avoid any markdown. Keep it plain text. Let me piece it all together now, ensuring the structure and constraints are met.
