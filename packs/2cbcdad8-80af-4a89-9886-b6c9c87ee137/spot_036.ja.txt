Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the tour guide about 鳥海高原花立牧場公園. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The user wants a 45-60 second narration in Japanese, with a calm guide tone. The structure should include a short intro, key facts, a fun tidbit, and a safety reminder. Also, I need to mention weather, terrain, and wildlife considerations without recommending excessive activities.

First, the intro should welcome visitors and mention the location. The key facts include the location at the foot of Chokai Mountain, the main attraction being the Jersey cow farm, and other facilities like go-karts, park golf, and an animal interaction area. The fun tidbit could be about the cows being friendly or the variety of activities. The safety reminder needs to mention weather, footing, and wildlife, but without suggesting risky behavior.

I should avoid using any metaphors and keep it factual. Also, make sure to use the correct place names. Let me check the facts again to ensure accuracy. The POI description says it's a leisure spot at the foot of Chokai Mountain, centered around the Jersey cow farm, with go-karts, park golf, and an animal interaction area. So the intro should mention the location, then the main attractions. The fun tidbit might be about the cows being approachable or the variety of activities. For safety, mention checking the weather, being cautious with uneven ground, and keeping a distance from wildlife. Avoid any speculation, so if there's anything unknown, just state it briefly. Since the user said to keep it self-contained, I can't reference other documents. Let me structure each part concisely. Let me count the words to ensure it's within 200-300 characters. Also, the output must be plain text only, no markdown. Let me draft the narration now, making sure each section flows naturally and meets all the constraints.
