Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically about Ganmansen Temple (spot_021). The facts provided mention it's a Jodo Shinshu temple in Okinagata, visited by Matsuo Basho who wrote a haiku there. 

First, I need to structure the narration as per the constraints: short intro, key facts/history, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. Avoid excessive metaphors and ensure proper nouns are accurate. Also, include a safety note about weather, terrain, and wildlife without recommending risky actions.

Starting with the intro: mention the temple's location and its significance. Then, the key facts: it's a Jodo Shinshu temple, Basho's visit and the haiku. The fun tidbit could be that the haiku is still displayed there. For safety, remind visitors to check weather, watch their steps, and be cautious of wildlife. Need to keep it concise and self-contained, no references to external documents.

Check for any unknowns. The user said to avoid speculation, so if there's any uncertainty, mention it briefly. But in this case, the facts are clear. Now, ensure the safety part is a single sentence. Let me draft each section step by step, making sure the flow is smooth and meets all constraints.
