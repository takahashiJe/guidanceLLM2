Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the spot 竜ヶ原湿原 (ID: spot_015) as a tour guide. Let me start by understanding the user's requirements. 

First, the structure should be: short intro, key facts/history/nature, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. I need to avoid excessive metaphors and ensure proper nouns are accurate. Also, include a safety note about weather, footing, and wildlife without recommending excessive actions.

The facts given are that it's a highland marsh in the middle of 鳥海山, known for high-altitude plants like ワタスゲ and ニッコウキスゲ. The fun tidbit could be something like the name's origin or a unique fact. Safety reminder should mention weather, terrain, and wildlife.

Let me check the Japanese terms again. ワタスゲ is Watasige, and ニッコウキスゲ is Nikkoukisuge. The name 竜ヶ原湿原 might refer to a dragon's plain marsh. Maybe the fun fact is that the name comes from a local legend or the shape of the marsh. 

For safety, I should mention to be cautious of weather changes, unstable ground, and wildlife like insects or animals. Avoid suggesting to venture too far. 

Putting it all together: Start with a welcoming intro, mention the location and key plants, add a fun fact about the name, then the safety note. Keep it concise. Let me check the character count to ensure it's within the limit. Also, make sure not to reference any external documents.
