Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically for the spot 鳥海高原花立牧場公園. The facts provided mention it's a leisure spot in the north foot of Chokai Mountain, with a Jersey cow farm, go-karts, park golf, and an animal interaction area. The structure needs to be short intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder, and include a safety note about weather, terrain, and wildlife without recommending excessive activities.

First, the intro should be welcoming. Maybe start with "ご案内します" to greet visitors. Then mention the location and main attractions. The key facts should highlight the Jersey cows, the various activities, and that it's family-friendly. The fun tidbit could be about the cows' friendly nature or the animal interaction area. For safety, mention weather, terrain, and wildlife, like checking the weather, being cautious on uneven ground, and keeping a distance from wildlife. Need to keep it around 200-300 characters, so concise. Avoid any speculation, so stick to the given facts. Make sure to use the correct names and avoid overused metaphors. Also, ensure the safety note is included without suggesting risky behavior. Let me check the example response to see if I'm on the right track. The example starts with a greeting, mentions the location and main attractions, adds a fun fact about the cows, and ends with safety tips. I should follow that structure. Let me draft it now, keeping each part brief and within the constraints.
