Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the tour guide about the 花立クリーンハイツ. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The user wants a 45-60 second narration in Japanese, with a calm guide tone. The structure should include a short intro, key facts, a fun tidbit, and a safety reminder. Also, avoid speculation and keep it self-contained. 

First, the intro should mention the spot's name and its role as a tourist hub. Then, the key facts: it's a facility in 鳥海高原, has a restaurant, info corner, and check-in for cottages. The popular item is the Jersey soft cream. 

For the fun tidbit, maybe mention the popular item again, like the soft cream being a must-try. 

Safety reminder needs to include weather, footing, and wildlife. Since the user specified to avoid recommending excessive actions, just a brief note about checking weather and being cautious with wildlife. 

I need to make sure all proper nouns are correct. Also, avoid any metaphors or over-the-top language. Keep it straightforward. Let me check the constraints again: no references to the document, self-contained, plain text only. 

Now, structuring each part. Start with the intro, then key facts, fun fact, safety. Keep each section concise. Let me draft in Japanese, making sure the flow is natural and meets the time constraint. Also, ensure the safety part is included as a final note. Let me put it all together now.
