Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically for the 鳥海高原花立牧場公園. The facts provided mention it's a leisure spot in the north foot of Chokai Mountain, featuring a Jersey cow ranch, go-karts, park golf, and an animal interaction area, suitable for families.

First, I need to structure the narration into four parts: short intro, key facts, fun tidbit, and safety reminder. The tone should be calm and informative, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. Avoid any speculation, so stick to the given facts. Also, include a safety note about weather, terrain, and wildlife without recommending risky activities.

Starting with the intro: Greet the visitors and mention the location. Then key facts: mention the Jersey cows, the attractions like go-karts and park golf, and the family-friendly aspect. The fun tidbit could be about the animal interaction area. For safety, remind them to check weather, watch their steps, and be cautious of wildlife, but avoid suggesting specific actions.

Need to ensure all proper nouns are correct, like 鳥海高原花立牧場公園. Avoid overusing metaphors. Keep it self-contained without referencing external documents. Output plain text only. Let me check the character count to make sure it's within the limit. Also, make sure the safety reminder is concise and adds value without being too alarmist.
