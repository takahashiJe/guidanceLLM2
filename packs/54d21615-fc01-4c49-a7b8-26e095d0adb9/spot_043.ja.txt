Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the tour guide about the 花立クリーンハイツ. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The user wants a professional guide in Japanese, with a calm tone, around 45-60 seconds, 200-300 characters. Structure is intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. Avoid speculation, use exact names, no excessive metaphors. Also, include a safety note about weather, footing, wildlife, and avoid recommending risky actions.

First, the introduction should be short. Maybe start with welcoming visitors to the area and introducing the spot. Then key facts: it's a tourist base, has a restaurant, info corner, check-in for cottages, and the popular Jersey soft cream. Fun tidbit could be the soft cream's popularity. Safety reminder needs to mention weather, footing, wildlife, but not recommend risky behavior. 

Wait, the facts mention the restaurant and info corner, check-in for adjacent cottages, and the Jersey soft cream. Need to make sure all those points are covered. Also, the safety part should be a brief mention. Let me check the constraints again: no references to the document, self-contained. So I can't mention anything else beyond what's given.

Let me structure it step by step. Start with intro: "訪れる皆様へ、花立クリーンハイツへようこそ。" Then key facts: tourist base, restaurant, info corner, check-in for cottages, Jersey soft cream. Fun tidbit: the soft cream's popularity. Safety: check weather, footing, wildlife. 

Wait, the user wants the safety reminder to include consideration for weather, footing, and wildlife, but avoid recommending excessive actions. So maybe something like "天候や足元、野生動物への配慮が必要です。過度な行動はお控えください。" 

Putting it all together, making sure it's concise. Let me count the characters. The example response is around 200-300 characters. Let me check each part. 

Intro: 10-15 words. Key facts: 30-40 words. Fun tidbit: 10-15 words. Safety: 15-20 words. Total should be around 70-90 words, which fits the 200-300 character limit. 

Need to ensure that the names are correct, like 花立クリーンハイツ and ヤシの実. Also, avoid any speculation. Make sure the safety part is included. Alright, I think that's covered.
