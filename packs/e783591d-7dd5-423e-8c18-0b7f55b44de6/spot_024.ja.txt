Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically about 祓川神社. The facts provided mention it's at the base of 鳥海山矢島口, a mountain shrine where hikers pray for safety. The structure needs to be intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. Also, include a safety note about weather, footing, and wildlife without recommending excessive action.

First, the intro should be brief, maybe mention the location and its significance. Then key facts: it's at the mountain's base, many hikers visit for safety. Fun tidbit could be about the name or something unique. Safety reminder needs to mention weather, footing, wildlife, and advise caution.

Wait, the user specified to avoid speculation. So if I don't know something, I should say so briefly. But the facts given are straightforward. The name "祓川" might relate to purification, but maybe that's part of the history. The fun tidbit could be that the shrine is a popular spot for starting hikes. Safety reminder: check weather, watch your step, be aware of wildlife. Don't recommend risky behavior.

Need to keep it around 200-300 characters. Let me check the example response. It starts with a greeting, mentions the location, the shrine's role, a fun fact about the name, and safety tips. The example is concise and meets the structure. I should follow that model but ensure the safety note is included as per the user's instruction. Also, use plain text without markdown. Let me structure each part step by step, making sure each section is covered without adding extra info.
