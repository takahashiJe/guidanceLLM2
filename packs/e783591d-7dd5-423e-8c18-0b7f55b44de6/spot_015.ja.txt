Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically about the 鳴ヶ原湿原 (ID: spot_015). The facts mention it's a high-altitude wetland with plants like わたすげ and ニッコウキスゲ. 

First, I need to structure the narration into four parts: short intro, key facts, fun tidbit, and safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. Avoid overusing metaphors and keep it self-contained without referencing external documents.

Starting with the intro: mention the location and its status as a treasure of alpine plants. Then, the key facts: it's in the middle of 鳥海山, known for those specific plants. The fun tidbit could be about the name's origin, maybe the "dragon" part. For safety, mention weather, terrain, and wildlife. Need to avoid speculation, so if anything is unknown, just state it briefly. Also, ensure the safety part includes considerations for weather, footing, and wildlife without recommending excessive activity.

Check for any specific terms that need to be accurate. Make sure not to use any markdown and keep it plain text. Let me piece this together, keeping each section concise. Let me verify the length. Maybe start with a greeting, then the main points, and end with the safety note. Let me draft that.

こんにちは。龍ヶ原湿原は、鳥海山の中腹に広がる高層湿原で、ワタスゲやニッコウキスゲなどの高山植物が自生する貴重な場所です。季節によっては、花々が群生してまるで絵のように美しく、自然の宝庫として知られています。実は、地名の「龍ヶ原」は、かつてこの地に伝説の龍がいたとされる由来があるんですよ。足元は湿った地面で滑りやすいので、歩行には注意が必要です。天候の急変や野生動物の出没にも配慮し、無理な行動は避けましょう。安全第一で楽しんでください。
