Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the spot 竜ヶ原湿原 (ID: spot_015) as a tour guide. Let me start by understanding the user's requirements.

First, the structure: short intro, key facts/history/nature, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The language should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so about 200-300 words. I need to avoid excessive metaphors and keep it factual. Also, include a safety note about weather, footing, and wildlife, without recommending excessive activities.

The facts provided mention it's a highland marsh in the middle of 鳥海山, known for plants like わたすげ and ニッコウキスゲ. I should highlight that it's a treasure for alpine plants. The fun tidbit could be something like the name's origin or a unique fact. Maybe the name comes from the dragon-like shape of the marsh? Or perhaps a local legend? Wait, the user didn't mention any legends, so maybe stick to the name's meaning. Alternatively, the fact that it's a popular spot for photography or something like that.

Safety reminder: mention weather changes, uneven ground, and wildlife. Avoid suggesting risky behavior. Maybe something like "Please be cautious of changing weather and uneven terrain, and keep a safe distance from wildlife."

Let me check the constraints again. No speculation, so if I don't know something, I should mention it briefly. Since the facts are limited, I need to stay within the given info. The user wants the narration to be self-contained, so no references to other documents.

Putting it all together: Start with a welcoming intro, mention the location and its status as a plant treasure. Then the fun fact about the name, and safety tips. Keep the tone calm and informative. Make sure to use the correct terms and avoid over-embellishment.

こんにちは。竜ヶ原湿原は、鳥海山の中腹に広がる高層湿原で、ワタスゲやニッコウキスゲといった高山植物が生育する自然の宝庫です。標高の高い場所に位置するため、季節ごとの風景の変化が楽しめます。名称の由来は、湿原の広がりが龍の姿に似ていることからと伝えられています。足元は湿った土壌で滑りやすいため、歩行には注意が必要です。また、気温の急変や野生動物に出会う可能性もあるため、天候や足元に配慮し、安全に楽しんでください。
