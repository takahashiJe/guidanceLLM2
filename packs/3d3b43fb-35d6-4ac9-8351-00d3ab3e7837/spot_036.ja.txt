Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the tour guide in Japanese about the 鳥海高原花立牧場公園. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The user wants a 45-60 second narration, around 200-300 characters. The structure should have a short intro, key facts, a fun tidbit, and a safety reminder. Also, avoid speculation and keep it self-contained.

First, the intro should mention the location and that it's a family-friendly spot. The key facts include the Jersey cows, go-karts, park golf, and the animal interaction area. The fun tidbit might be about the cows being friendly. The safety reminder needs to mention weather, footing, and wildlife, without recommending risky actions.

I should check the facts again to make sure I'm accurate. The POI description says it's in the northern foot of Chokai Mountain, so I should mention that. The attractions are the farm, go-karts, park golf, and the interaction area. The fun fact could be that the cows are approachable. For safety, remind visitors to check the weather, watch their steps, and be cautious of wildlife, but without encouraging risky behavior.

Now, I need to structure this into the required sections. Start with the intro, then key facts, fun tidbit, and safety. Keep the language calm and informative. Avoid any markdown and just plain text. Let me make sure the Japanese is correct and natural. Also, check the character count to stay within the limit. Let me draft that.
