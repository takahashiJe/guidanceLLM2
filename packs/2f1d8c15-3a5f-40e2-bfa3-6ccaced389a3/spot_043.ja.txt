Okay, let's see. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the area around Mt. Chokai, specifically about the spot 花立クリーンハイツ. The facts provided mention it's a tourist facility with a restaurant, info corner, and check-in for cottages. The popular item is the Jersey soft cream.

First, I need to structure it into four parts: short intro, key facts, fun tidbit, and safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. Avoid any metaphors or speculation. Also, include a safety note about weather, footing, and wildlife without recommending excessive actions.

Starting with the intro: maybe something like "Next, we'll visit..." to introduce the spot. Then key facts: mention it's a tourist hub, the restaurant, info corner, check-in for cottages, and the soft cream. The fun tidbit could be the popularity of the soft cream. For safety, remind visitors to check weather, watch their steps, and be cautious of wildlife.

Wait, the user said to avoid speculation. So I shouldn't say anything about the soft cream's taste or why it's popular beyond the given info. Just state it's a popular item. Also, the safety part needs to be concise. Maybe something like "Please check the weather, watch your step, and be mindful of wildlife."

Let me check the constraints again. No references to documents or context. Use plain text only. Make sure the name is correct. Avoid overusing metaphors. Keep it self-contained.

Putting it all together: Start with the intro, then the key facts, the fun tidbit, then the safety reminder. Keep each part concise. Let me count the characters to ensure it's within the limit. Maybe around 250 characters. Let me draft it in Japanese now.
