Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the tour guide in Japanese about the 鳥海高原花立牧場公園. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The user wants a professional guide voice, calm and informative, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. The structure should have an intro, key facts, a fun tidbit, and a safety reminder. Also, avoid speculation and keep it self-contained. Plus, the safety note must mention weather, footing, and wildlife, without recommending excessive activities.

First, the intro. Should be brief, maybe start with the location. Then the key facts: it's in the north foot of Chokai Mountain, has a Jersey cow pasture, go-karts, park golf, and an animal interaction area. Need to mention family-friendly. 

For the fun tidbit, maybe something like the cows are friendly or the park golf is popular. Wait, the facts mention the animal interaction area, so maybe highlight that. 

Safety reminder: need to mention weather, footing, and wildlife. For example, check the weather, be cautious with the terrain, and keep a distance from wildlife. Avoid suggesting risky activities. 

Now, check the constraints. No speculation, so don't add anything not in the facts. Keep it concise. Let me structure each part step by step. 

Intro: "鳥海高原花立牧場公園は、鳥海山の北麓に広がるレジャースポットです。" 

Key facts: "ジャージー牛の牧場を中心に、ゴーカートやパークゴルフ、動物とのふれあい広場などがあり、家族で一日中楽しめます。" 

Fun tidbit: Maybe mention the cows are friendly? Or the variety of activities. Since the animal interaction area is there, maybe say "動物とのふれあい広場では、子どもたちに人気です。" 

Safety: "天候や足元に注意し、野生動物には距離を取ってください。" 

Wait, the user said to include safety considerations for weather, footing, and wildlife, but avoid recommending excessive activities. So the safety part should be a brief reminder. 

Putting it all together, making sure it's around 200-300 characters. Let me check the example response to see the structure. The example starts with the intro, then key facts, then a fun fact, then safety. 

Let me count the characters. The example given is about 200 characters. So I need to keep each section concise. 

Make sure to use the correct name: 鳥海高原花立牧場公園. Avoid any markdown. Just plain text. 

I think that's it. Now, draft the narration accordingly.
