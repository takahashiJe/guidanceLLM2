Okay, let me tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration in Japanese for a tour guide at 花立クリーンハイツ. The structure needs to be short intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. Also, they mentioned to avoid speculation and keep it self-contained.

First, the intro should be welcoming. Then mention the POI's role as a tourist hub with restaurant and info center. Highlight the popular Jersey soft cream. For the fun fact, maybe the nearby cottages are a nice touch. Safety reminder needs to include weather, footing, and wildlife. Avoid any recommendations for excessive activities.

Check if all the facts are covered. Make sure to use the correct names and not add any extra info. Keep it around 200-300 characters. Let me draft that in Japanese, ensuring the tone is calm and informative. Also, confirm that the safety part is concise and covers the required points without being too detailed. Alright, that should cover it.
