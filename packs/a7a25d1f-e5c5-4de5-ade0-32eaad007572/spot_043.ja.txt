Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically about the Hanatate Clean Heights (花立クリーンハイツ) with the given facts. 

First, I need to make sure I follow all the constraints. The style is a narration, so it should be calm and informative. The structure has four parts: short intro, key facts, fun tidbit, and safety reminder. Also, I need to mention weather, terrain, and wildlife precautions without recommending excessive activities.

Starting with the intro. It should be brief, maybe mention the location and its role as a tourist hub. Then the key facts: it's a facility with a restaurant, info corner, and check-in for cottages. Highlight the popular jersey soft cream. 

For the fun tidbit, maybe mention the popular item, like the soft cream, and add a bit of charm without overdoing it. 

Safety reminder needs to include weather, terrain, and wildlife. For example, check the weather before heading out, be cautious of uneven ground, and watch out for wildlife. Avoid suggesting risky activities. 

I should avoid any speculation. If there's any unknown info, just say so briefly, but in this case, the facts provided are clear. Also, keep it self-contained without referencing any documents. 

Check the length: around 200-300 characters. Let me count. The example given is about 200 characters. Need to keep it concise. 

Make sure to use the correct names in Japanese. Avoid overused metaphors. Keep the tone professional but friendly. 

Putting it all together: Start with the intro, mention the facility's role, key points about the restaurant and check-in, the popular item. Then add the fun fact about the soft cream. Safety reminder with weather, terrain, and wildlife. 

Wait, the user specified to include safety precautions in one sentence. So maybe combine weather, terrain, and wildlife into a single safety note. 

Let me draft it in Japanese, ensuring all parts are covered and the constraints are met. Check for any markdown and ensure it's plain text only. Okay, that should cover it.
