Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the tour guide in Japanese about the 鳥海高原花立牧場公園. Let's start by breaking down the user's requirements.

First, the structure has four parts: short intro, key facts/history/nature, fun tidbit, and safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, which is about 200-300 words. I need to avoid any speculation and ensure accuracy, especially with proper nouns. Also, the safety reminder must include considerations for weather, footing, and wildlife, without recommending excessive activities.

Starting with the intro: I should mention the location, maybe the name of the spot, and briefly what it's known for. Then, the key facts. The POI description says it's a leisure spot in the north foot of Chokai Mountain, centered around Jersey cows, with go-karts, park golf, and an animal interaction area. I should highlight these elements.

For the fun tidbit, maybe mention the Jersey cows or the animal interaction area as a highlight. The safety part needs to remind visitors about weather changes, uneven ground, and wildlife. I should keep it concise and avoid any over-the-top advice.

I need to make sure all the points are covered without being too verbose. Let me check the constraints again: no markdown, plain text only. Also, avoid excessive metaphors. Let me draft each section step by step, keeping the language natural and informative.
