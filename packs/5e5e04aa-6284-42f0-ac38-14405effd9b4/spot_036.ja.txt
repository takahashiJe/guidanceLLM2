Okay, let me tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically about the 鳥海高原花立牧場公園. The structure needs to be four parts: intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. Also, they want it in Japanese, with a calm guide tone, around 45-60 seconds, 200-300 characters. No speculation, just the facts given.

First, the intro should be brief. Maybe start with the location and what it's known for. The facts mention it's a leisure spot in the north foot of Chokai Mountain, with a Jersey cow farm, go-karts, park golf, and an animal interaction area. So the intro could mention it's a popular family destination.

Next, key facts: the POI description says it's a leisure spot with the Jersey cow farm as the center, and the other facilities. Need to mention those elements concisely. Also, the history or nature? Wait, the facts don't mention history, so maybe focus on the natural setting and the facilities.

Fun tidbit: Maybe something about the animals or the activities. Like the animal interaction area where kids can meet the cows. Or maybe the go-karts? But the user says to avoid overdone metaphors, so keep it simple.

Safety reminder: The user specified to include a note about weather, footing, and wildlife. So a brief mention like "Please check the weather and be cautious of uneven ground and wildlife." Also, avoid recommending risky actions.

Now, check the constraints. Use correct proper nouns, no speculation. Keep it self-contained. Output plain text only. Let me structure each part.

Intro: 鳥海高原花立牧場公園は、鳥海山の北麓に広がるレジャースポットで、家族連れに人気です。

Key facts: ジャージー牛の牧場を中心に、ゴーカートやパークゴルフ、動物とのふれあい広場などがあり、一日中楽しめます。

Fun tidbit: 牧場では、小さな子どもたちが牛と触れ合う体験もできます。

Safety reminder: 天候や足元、野生動物への配慮が必要です。過度な行動は避け、安全に楽しんでください。

Check the length. Let me count the characters. The example response is around 200-300 characters. Combine all parts into a smooth narration without markdown. Make sure it's natural and flows well. Avoid any markdown formatting. Okay, that should work.
