Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically about Ganmansen Temple (ID: spot_021). The facts mention it's a Jodo-shu temple in Oshigata, visited by Sakutarō Hagiwara, and known for his haiku.

First, I need to structure the narration into four parts: intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. Avoid overused metaphors and ensure proper nouns are correct. Also, include a safety note about weather, footing, and wildlife without recommending excessive activity.

Starting with the intro: briefly introduce the temple. Then mention its location, the fact that Hagiwara visited and wrote a haiku. The fun tidbit could be that the temple's name relates to the area's natural features. For safety, remind visitors to check weather, watch their steps, and be cautious of wildlife, but without encouraging risky behavior.

Need to make sure not to speculate or reference external documents. Keep everything self-contained. Let me check the character count. Also, ensure the safety part is concise. Maybe something like "天候や足元、野生動物にご注意ください" to keep it simple and within the constraints.

このスポットは、象潟にある曹洞宗の伽藍、 Ganmansen Temple（がんまんじんじ）です。松尾芭蕉が「おくのほそ道」の旅で訪れ、その地に句を詠んだことで知られます。境内は自然と調和した静かな空間で、四季の移ろいを感じられます。興味深いのは、寺名の「満」が、周辺の豊かな海と自然を連想させる由来があるとされます。天候や足元、野生動物にご注意ください。
