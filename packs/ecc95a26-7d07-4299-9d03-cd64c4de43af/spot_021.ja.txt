Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration in Japanese for a tour guide at Ganmam Temple (spot_021). The facts mention it's a temple in Oshigata, part of the Sōtō school, and that Matsuo Bashō visited and composed a poem there. 

First, I need to structure it into the four parts: intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds. Let me start with a short intro introducing the temple.

Next, key facts: mention the location, the temple's affiliation, and Bashō's visit. Need to include the poem fact. Then a fun tidbit. Maybe the poem's content or the temple's significance. 

For the safety reminder, the user specified to mention weather, footing, and wildlife. I should add a brief note about checking the weather and being cautious with the surroundings. Avoid recommending excessive activities. 

Wait, the user said to avoid speculation and if unknown, say so briefly. Since the facts provided are limited, I need to stick to what's given. Also, avoid overusing metaphors. Keep it straightforward. 

Let me check the constraints again. No markdown, plain text. Solid structure. Let me draft each section step by step. 

Intro: "皆様、象潟にある曹洞宗の伽藍、 Ganmam寺へようこそ。" That's the intro. 

Key facts: "松尾芭蕉が「おくのほそ道」の旅で訪問し、句を詠んだことで知られています。" 

Fun tidbit: Maybe mention the specific poem or the temple's serene atmosphere. Since the original facts don't specify the poem's content, maybe say "静かな空間で句を詠んだ" to keep it general. 

Safety reminder: "天候や足元、野生動物にご注意ください。" 

Check the length. Should be around 200-300 characters. Let me count. The example response is 231 characters. Let me make sure each part is covered without extra info. Avoid any markdown. 

I think that's all. Let me put it all together.
