Okay, the user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide at the 道の駅象潟. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the structure needs to be short intro, key facts, fun tidbit, and safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so about 200-300 words. I need to make sure to use the correct place names and avoid overused metaphors. Also, the safety part should mention weather, footing, and wildlife, without recommending excessive activities.

The facts given are that it's a roadside station with an ocean view hot spring, local specialties, and a restaurant. The fun tidbit could be something like the hot spring's name or a local story. Wait, the facts don't mention a name, so maybe the hot spring's name isn't specified. I should check if there's any additional info, but the user said to avoid speculation. So maybe just mention the hot spring is popular without details.

Safety reminder needs to be concise. Maybe something like "Please be cautious of slippery surfaces near the hot spring and check weather conditions before heading out." Also, mention wildlife if applicable, but since it's a coastal area, maybe not necessary unless there are specific animals. The user said to include wildlife, so maybe mention being mindful of local wildlife.

Let me draft the intro: Welcome to 道の駅象潟, a roadside station with an ocean view hot spring. Then key facts: it's popular for the hot spring, sells local products and seafood, has a restaurant. Fun tidbit: the hot spring is known for its relaxing effects. Safety: be cautious of slippery areas, check weather, and watch for wildlife.

Wait, the user specified to avoid speculation. If the hot spring's name isn't given, I can't assume. So the fun tidbit could be about the local specialties or the view. Maybe the restaurant's cuisine? Or the fact that it's a good place to rest after hiking. Need to keep it simple.

Safety part: "Please be mindful of wet surfaces near the hot spring area and check weather conditions before visiting. Also, be cautious of local wildlife such as deer or birds." That's concise and covers the required points.

Let me put it all together in Japanese, keeping it natural and within the word limit. Make sure not to mention any external references. Check for any incorrect terms. Okay, that should work.
