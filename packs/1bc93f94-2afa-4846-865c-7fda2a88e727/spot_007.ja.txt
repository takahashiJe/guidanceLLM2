Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the spot 法体の滝 (ID: spot_007) as a tour guide. Let me start by understanding the user's requirements.

First, the structure: intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The language should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. I need to avoid excessive metaphors and stick to facts. Also, include safety considerations about weather, footing, and wildlife without recommending excessive actions.

The facts given are that it's part of the Japanese 100 Waterfalls selection, with water from Chokai Mountain flowing in three steps. The fun tidbit could be something like the name's origin or a local legend. For safety, mention weather changes, slippery rocks, and wildlife like snakes or insects.

Wait, the user said to avoid speculation. So if there's no info on the name's origin, maybe skip that. Alternatively, check if there's any known tidbit. Since the user didn't provide it, maybe use the fact that it's a popular spot, so visitors should be cautious.

Also, the safety reminder needs to be concise. Maybe: "Please be mindful of changing weather, slippery rocks, and wildlife such as snakes and insects. Exercise caution and avoid risky behavior."

Let me structure the intro: "Welcome to 法体の滝, one of Japan's 100 Waterfalls..." Then key facts about the three-step cascade from Chokai Mountain. Fun tidbit: maybe the name's meaning? If unsure, maybe skip. Alternatively, mention it's a popular spot for photography. Then safety reminder as above.

Check the constraints again: no markdown, plain text only. Keep it self-contained. Make sure to mention the safety aspects without overstepping. Avoid any unknown info. Let me draft it now.
