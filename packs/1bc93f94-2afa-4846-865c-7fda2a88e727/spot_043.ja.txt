Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically for the spot 花立クリーンハイツ. The facts provided mention it's a tourist facility with a restaurant, info corner, and check-in for nearby cottages, plus the popular Jersey soft cream.

First, I need to structure the narration into four parts: short intro, key facts, fun tidbit, and safety reminder. The tone should be calm and informative, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. Avoid any speculation and keep it self-contained. Also, include a safety note about weather, terrain, and wildlife without recommending excessive activities.

Starting with the intro: Introduce the location as a base for the area. Then mention the key points: restaurant, info corner, check-in for cottages, and the soft cream. The fun tidbit could be the Jersey soft cream's popularity. For safety, mention checking weather, being cautious with terrain, and wildlife. Need to make sure all proper nouns are correct and avoid overused metaphors.

Check if all facts are covered. The user didn't mention anything about history, so focus on the given info. Safety reminder should be concise. Let me count the characters to ensure it's within the limit. Also, make sure the output is plain text only, no markdown. Alright, let me put it all together now.
