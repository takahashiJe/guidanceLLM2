Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the tour guide in Japanese. The spot is 鳥海高原花立牧場公園 (ID: spot_036). Let me start by understanding the facts provided. The POI description mentions it's a leisure spot in the northern foot of Chokai Mountain, featuring a Jersey cow ranch, go-karts, park golf, and an animal interaction area, suitable for families to enjoy all day.

First, the structure needs to be: short intro, key facts/history/nature, fun tidbit, safety reminder. Also, the tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so about 200-300 characters. Avoid excessive metaphors and ensure proper nouns are accurate. No speculation, so if something is unknown, mention it briefly. Keep it self-contained without referencing other documents. And add a safety note about weather, footing, and wildlife, without recommending excessive activities.

Starting with the intro: Maybe something like "皆様、鳥海高原花立牧場公園へようこそ。" Then mention the location as the northern foot of Chokai Mountain. Next, key facts: the main attraction is the Jersey cow ranch, then the other facilities like go-karts, park golf, and the animal interaction area. The fun tidbit could be that the cows are friendly, so kids can feed them. For safety, mention to be cautious of weather changes, uneven ground, and wildlife, advising to follow signs and stay alert.

Wait, the user wants a safety reminder that includes weather, footing, and wildlife. Also, avoid recommending excessive activities. So the safety part should be a brief note, maybe at the end. Let me check the character count. Let me draft the Japanese text now, making sure it's concise and fits the structure. Need to ensure no markdown and plain text only. Also, avoid any speculation, so if there's anything unknown, just say "不明" briefly if needed. But the facts provided seem sufficient. Let me put it all together.
