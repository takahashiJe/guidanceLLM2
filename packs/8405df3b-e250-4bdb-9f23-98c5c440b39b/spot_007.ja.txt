Okay, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want a spoken narration in Japanese for a tour guide, specifically about 法体の滝 (spot_007). The structure needs to include a short intro, key facts, a fun tidbit, and a safety reminder. Also, they mentioned to avoid speculation and keep it self-contained.

First, the intro should be brief. Maybe start with welcoming visitors and introducing the waterfall. Then, the key facts: it's one of Japan's 100 Selected Waterfalls, with water from Chokai Mountain cascading in three steps. Need to mention the grandeur of the cascade.

Next, the fun tidbit. The user mentioned a fun fact, so perhaps something about the water's clarity or a local legend. Wait, the facts section doesn't mention a legend, so maybe the fact that it's a popular spot for photography? Or maybe the name "法体" has a meaning? Wait, the facts don't specify, so I shouldn't make up anything. The user said to avoid speculation, so if the facts don't mention a legend, I can't include it. Maybe the fact that it's a popular spot for visitors?

Then the safety reminder. The user wants a note about weather, footing, and wildlife. So I need to mention to be cautious of slippery rocks, changing weather, and possible wildlife. Also, avoid recommending excessive activities.

Now, checking the constraints: use a calm guide tone, 45-60 seconds, around 200-300 characters. Avoid overused metaphors. Use correct proper nouns. Keep it self-contained without referencing any documents.

Let me draft the intro: "ご来光の皆様、法体の滝へようこそ。" Then mention it's part of Japan's 100 Waterfalls, the three-step cascade from Chokai Mountain. Fun tidbit: maybe the water's clarity or the surrounding nature. Wait, the facts don't specify, so perhaps the fact that it's a popular spot for photography? Or the name's meaning? Wait, the user's facts don't mention any, so maybe the fun tidbit is that it's a popular spot for visitors. But the user might expect a more specific tidbit. Alternatively, since the facts don't include any, perhaps the fun tidbit is that it's a great spot for taking photos. But the user said to avoid speculation, so maybe the fun tidbit is just that it's a popular attraction. Alternatively, maybe the fact that the water is clear and refreshing. Wait, the facts don't mention that, so I can't assume. Maybe the fun tidbit is that the waterfall is a popular spot for visitors, so it's a must-see. 

Safety reminder: "天候や足元、野生動物への配慮を。" So mention slippery rocks, changing weather, and wildlife. Also, avoid recommending excessive activities. 

Putting it all together, keeping it concise. Let me check the character count. The example response is 200-300 characters. Let me make sure each part is covered without being too long. 

Now, write the narration in Japanese, following the structure and constraints. Make sure proper nouns are correct, like 法体の滝 and 鳥海山. Avoid overused metaphors. Keep the tone calm and informative.
