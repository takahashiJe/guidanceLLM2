Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in Japanese, focusing on the 鳥海高原花立牧場公園. The structure needs to be short intro, key facts, fun tidbit, and safety reminder. Also, they mentioned to include a safety note about weather, terrain, and wildlife, without recommending excessive activities.

First, I need to make sure the introduction is welcoming and sets the scene. The key facts include the location at the foot of Chokai Mountain, the main attraction being the Jersey cow farm, and other facilities like go-karts and park golf. The fun tidbit could be something like the cows being friendly or a unique feature. For safety, mention weather, terrain, and wildlife briefly.

I should avoid any speculation, so if there's anything unknown, just state it. Keep the tone calm and informative. Let me check the constraints again: no markdown, plain text only. Also, ensure the solid nouns are correct, like the park's name and the POI description. Need to keep it around 200-300 characters, which is about 45-60 seconds when spoken. Let me draft each section step by step, making sure each part flows naturally and meets the requirements.
