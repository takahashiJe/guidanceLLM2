Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically about the Ryugetsu Gen Wetland (竜ヶ原湿原). The facts provided mention it's a high-altitude wetland in the middle of Mount Chokai, known for its alpine plants like Watasgae and Nikkou Kishu. 

First, I need to structure the narration according to the given constraints: short intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone should be calm and informative, around 45-60 seconds, which is about 200-300 characters. I have to avoid speculation and keep it self-contained. Also, include a safety note about weather, terrain, and wildlife without recommending excessive activities.

Starting with the intro: Introduce the spot as a high-altitude wetland. Then mention the key facts about the plants. The fun tidbit could be something like the name's origin or a unique feature. For safety, remind visitors to check weather, watch their steps, and be cautious of wildlife. 

Wait, the user specified to avoid over-the-top metaphors, so keep it straightforward. Make sure to use the correct terms like "Watasgae" and "Nikkou Kishu". Also, the safety part needs to be concise. Let me check if I have all the elements. 

Intro: Location and general description. Key facts: plants. Fun tidbit: maybe the name's meaning or a unique aspect. Safety: weather, terrain, wildlife. 

Need to make sure the total is around 200-300 characters. Let me draft it in Japanese, keeping each section concise. Avoid any markdown and just plain text. Also, ensure that the safety reminder is included as a separate point. Alright, putting it all together now.
