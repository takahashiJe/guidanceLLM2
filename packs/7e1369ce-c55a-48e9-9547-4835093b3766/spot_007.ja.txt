Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the visitor guide at 法体の滝. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The user wants a professional tour guide style in Japanese, around 45-60 seconds, so about 200-300 characters. The structure should include a short intro, key facts, a fun tidbit, and a safety reminder. Also, avoid speculation and keep it self-contained without referencing any external documents.

First, the spot is 法体の滝 (spot_007), which is part of the Japanese 100 Famous Waterfalls. The main facts are that it's selected as one of the 100, and the water from Chokai-san flows in three steps. The intro should be brief, maybe mention the name and its status. Then the key facts: the three-tier waterfall and its selection. The fun tidbit could be something like the local legend or a unique fact. For safety, mention weather, footing, and wildlife, but without recommending excessive activity.

Wait, the user specified to avoid over-the-top metaphors and use accurate proper nouns. So I need to make sure the facts are correct. The safety part should be a single sentence. Let me check the constraints again. No speculation, so if there's any unknown info, just say so briefly. Since the facts given are about the waterfall's status and the three tiers, maybe the fun tidbit could be that it's called "Hōtei no Taki" which might relate to the Bodhisattva Hōtei, but I'm not sure if that's a local legend. Alternatively, maybe the water's clarity or the surrounding nature. Also, the safety reminder needs to mention weather, footing, and wildlife, but not encourage risky behavior.

Putting it all together: Start with the name and its status. Then describe the three tiers. Fun fact could be the local name's origin. Safety reminder about checking weather, being cautious on wet rocks, and avoiding wildlife areas. Keep the tone calm and informative. Let me draft that in Japanese now, making sure it's concise and meets all the requirements.
