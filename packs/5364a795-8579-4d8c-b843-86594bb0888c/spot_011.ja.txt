Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically for the spot 道の駅象潟 (ID: spot_011). The facts provided mention it's a viewpoint with a hot spring, local products, and a restaurant. 

First, I need to structure the narration as per the constraints: short intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters in Japanese. 

Starting with the intro, maybe something like welcoming visitors to the area. Then mention the key points: the view of the Japan Sea, the hot spring, and the available local products and restaurant. 

For the fun tidbit, perhaps a local specialty or a unique feature. The user mentioned the restaurant is combined, so maybe a local dish? Wait, the facts don't specify, so I should avoid speculation. Maybe the hot spring is popular, so maybe mention that it's a popular spot for relaxation. 

Safety reminder needs to include weather, footing, and wildlife. Since it's near the sea, maybe mention weather changes and slippery paths. Also, wildlife like deer or birds? But the user says to avoid over-the-top recommendations, so just a brief note. 

Check for any unknowns. The facts don't mention history, so maybe focus on the present. Avoid any references to the document or context. Keep it self-contained. 

Now, putting it all together. Start with the intro, then key facts, then the fun tidbit, and safety. Make sure to use the correct terms and avoid overused metaphors. Let me count the characters to ensure it's within the limit. Also, check that the safety part is concise. Alright, that should cover it.
