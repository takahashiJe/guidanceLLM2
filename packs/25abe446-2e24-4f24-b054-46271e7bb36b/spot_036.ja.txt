Okay, the user wants me to act as a tour guide for visitors around Mt. Chokai, specifically focusing on the spot_036, which is 鳥海高原花立牧場公園. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the narration needs to be in Japanese, with a calm guide tone, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. The structure should include a short intro, key facts, a fun tidbit, and a safety reminder. Also, I need to mention weather, terrain, and wildlife precautions without recommending excessive activities.

The facts provided mention it's a leisure spot in the north foot of Chokai Mountain, centered around a Jersey cow farm with go-karts, park golf, and an animal interaction area. The fun tidbit could be about the cows being friendly. Safety reminder should include weather, terrain, and wildlife. Need to avoid speculation and keep it self-contained.

Let me check the structure. Start with an intro about the location. Then mention the main attractions. The fun fact about the cows. Then the safety part. Make sure to use the correct terms like 鳥海山 and avoid any metaphors. Keep it straightforward. Also, ensure that the safety reminder is concise and covers all three aspects: weather, terrain, and wildlife. Let me put it all together now.
