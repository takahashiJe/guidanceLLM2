Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration in Japanese for a tour guide at the 花立クリーンハイツ. The structure needs to be four parts: intro, key facts, fun tidbit, and safety reminder. Also, they mentioned to avoid speculation and keep it self-contained.

First, the intro should be short. Maybe start with welcoming visitors and mentioning it's a hub. Then the key facts: it's a tourist facility with a restaurant, info corner, and check-in for cottages. The popular item is the Jersey soft cream. Need to mention those points clearly.

For the fun tidbit, maybe the Jersey soft cream being a local favorite. Then the safety reminder: weather, footing, and wildlife. But avoid recommending excessive actions. Just a brief note about being cautious.

Check the constraints again. No markdown, plain text. Keep it around 200-300 characters. Let me make sure the proper nouns are correct. Also, avoid overusing metaphors. Let me draft each section step by step, then combine them. Make sure the safety part is concise. Maybe end with a polite reminder. Okay, that should cover it.
