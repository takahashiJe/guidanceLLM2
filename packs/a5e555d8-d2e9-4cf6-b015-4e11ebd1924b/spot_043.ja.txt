Okay, I need to create a spoken narration in Japanese for the tour guide about the 花立クリーンハイツ. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the structure: intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The user specified around 45-60 seconds, so about 200-300 characters. The tone should be calm and professional, like a guide. I have to avoid overused metaphors and keep it self-contained without references to other documents.

The facts provided are that it's a tourist facility in 鳥海高原, with a restaurant, tourist information corner, and check-in for adjacent cottages. The popular item is the Jersey soft cream. Also, need to include a safety reminder about weather, footing, and wildlife, without recommending excessive actions.

Let me start with the intro. Maybe something like "This is the 花立クリーンハイツ, a key tourist facility in 鳥海高原." Then the key facts: mention the restaurant, tourist info, check-in for cottages, and the Jersey soft cream. The fun tidbit could be about the soft cream being a local favorite. For safety, mention weather, footing, and wildlife, advising caution.

Need to make sure all proper nouns are correct. Avoid any speculation, so if there's anything unknown, just state it briefly. Also, keep it plain text only. Let me check the character count to ensure it's within the limit. Let me put it all together now.

このはなたてクリーンハイツは、鳥海高原の観光拠点施設です。レストランや観光案内コーナーがあり、隣接するコテージのチェックインもここで行います。特に人気なのはジャージーソフトクリームで、地元の味覚を楽しめます。また、観光客向けの情報も豊富に提供しています。天候や足元の確認を忘れず、野生動物に注意して行動してください。過度な行動は控え、安全を第一に。
