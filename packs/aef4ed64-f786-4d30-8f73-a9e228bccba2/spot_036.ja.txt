Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically for the spot 鳥海高原花立牧場公園. The facts provided include it's a leisure spot in the north foot of Chokai-san, with a Jersey cow farm, go-kart, park golf, and an animal interaction area. They need a 45-60 second narration in Japanese, with a calm guide tone.

First, I need to structure it into four parts: short intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The constraints mention avoiding speculation and keeping it self-contained. Also, include a safety note about weather, terrain, and wildlife without recommending excessive activities.

Starting with the intro: maybe mention the location and main attraction. Then key facts: the Jersey cows, the various facilities. The fun tidbit could be about the animal interaction area. Safety reminder should mention weather, footing, wildlife, and not to take unnecessary risks.

Need to check the word count. Let me draft each section. Make sure to use the correct names and avoid overused metaphors. Keep it concise. Also, ensure the safety part is brief but covers the required points. Let me put it all together now.
