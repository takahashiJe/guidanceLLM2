Okay, let me start by understanding the user's request. They want a spoken narration in Japanese for a tour guide, specifically about the 赤滝 (Akatake) spot near Mt. Chokai. The facts provided mention that it's near Fushikawa and has a powerful appearance during snowmelt periods.

First, I need to structure the narration according to the given constraints: a short intro, key facts, a fun tidbit, and a safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, which translates to about 200-300 characters. I have to avoid excessive metaphors and ensure proper nouns are accurate. Also, the safety reminder must include considerations for weather, footing, and wildlife, without recommending risky behavior.

Starting with the intro: I should greet the visitors and mention the location. Then, the key facts would include the location near Fushikawa and the seasonal aspect of snowmelt. The fun tidbit could be something like the name's meaning or a local legend. For safety, I need to mention checking weather, being cautious with footing, and avoiding wildlife areas. I should also make sure not to speculate on unknown information and keep everything self-contained.

Wait, the user specified to avoid speculation, so if there's any unknown info, just say so briefly. Since the facts provided are limited, I need to stick to what's given. The name "赤滝" translates to "Red Waterfall," so maybe the fun tidbit could relate to that. Also, the safety part needs to be concise but cover the three points: weather, footing, wildlife. Let me check the character count to ensure it's within the limit. Let me draft each section step by step, making sure the structure is followed and the constraints are met.
