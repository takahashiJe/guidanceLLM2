Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration in Japanese for a tour guide at Mt. Chokai's 鳥海山 area, specifically for the spot 竜ヶ原湿原 (ID: spot_015). The facts provided mention it's a high-altitude wetland with rare alpine plants likeワタスゲ andニッコウキスゲ. 

First, I need to structure the narration as per the constraints: short intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. Avoid overly metaphorical language and ensure proper nouns are correct.

Starting with the intro: maybe greet the visitors and mention the location. Then key facts: describe the wetland, mention the plants. Fun tidbit: perhaps something about the plants or the area's significance. Safety reminder: weather, terrain, wildlife. Need to keep it self-contained without referencing external documents.

Wait, the user specified to avoid speculation. So if there's anything unknown, just say so briefly. The safety part needs to mention weather, footing, and wildlife. Also, avoid recommending excessive activities. 

Let me check the facts again. The POI description says it's a high-altitude wetland with alpine plants. So the key points are the location (middle of the mountain), the plants, and maybe the ecological importance. The fun tidbit could be that it's a haven for these plants. For safety, mention weather changes, unstable ground, and wildlife like insects or animals. 

Putting it all together: Start with a welcome, mention the location and its status as a plant haven. Then the fun fact about the specific plants. Safety reminder about weather, terrain, and wildlife. Keep it concise. Let me count the characters to ensure it's within the limit. Avoid any markdown, just plain text. Make sure the safety part is included as per the user's request.
