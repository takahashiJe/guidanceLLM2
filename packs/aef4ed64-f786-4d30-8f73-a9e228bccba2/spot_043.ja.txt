Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically about the 花立クリーンハイツ. The facts provided are that it's a tourist facility with a restaurant, info corner, and check-in for adjacent cottages, and they have a popular Jersey soft ice cream.

First, I need to structure it into four parts: intro, key facts, fun tidbit, and safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. Avoid any speculation, so if something isn't mentioned, just state it. Also, include a safety note about weather, footing, and wildlife without recommending risky actions.

Starting with the intro: Mention the location as a base for tourism. Then key facts: the facilities like restaurant, info corner, check-in for cottages, and the ice cream. The fun tidbit could be the popularity of the ice cream. For safety, mention checking weather and footing, and being cautious around wildlife without suggesting specific actions.

Need to make sure all proper nouns are correct, like the name of the place. Avoid metaphors. Keep it self-contained, no references to other documents. Output plain text only. Let me check the character count to ensure it's within the limit. Also, ensure the safety part is concise and fits the structure.
