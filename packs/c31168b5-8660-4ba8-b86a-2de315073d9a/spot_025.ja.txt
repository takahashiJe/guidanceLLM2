Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically about 赤滝 (spot_025). The facts provided mention it's near 赓川 and has powerful waterfalls during snowmelt. 

First, I need to structure the narration as per the constraints: intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds. Let me start with the intro, maybe something like welcoming visitors to the area and introducing the spot.

Next, the key facts. I should mention the location near 赓川 and the seasonal aspect of snowmelt. Need to keep it concise. Then the fun tidbit—maybe a historical fact or a unique detail. Wait, the facts don't mention any history, so maybe the tidbit could be about the name "赤滝" meaning red waterfall, possibly due to the color of the water or surrounding rocks. 

Safety reminder is crucial. The user specified to include weather, footing, and wildlife. So I should mention checking weather, being cautious on wet rocks, and avoiding wildlife areas. Also, avoid recommending excessive activities. 

I need to make sure not to use any speculation. If there's no info on history, I shouldn't add it. Keep it self-contained. Let me check the word count. The example response is around 200-300 characters. Let me draft each section step by step, ensuring the flow and meeting all constraints.

いらっしゃいませ。赤滝は、賡川の近くに位置する滝で、春の雪解け時期には水量が増し、迫力が際立つスポットです。名前の由来は、周辺の赤い岩や水の色合いからとられる説があります。ご注意ください。天候によって足元が滑りやすくなるため、雨天時は特に気をつけてください。また、野生動物の生息域に近い場所ですので、立ち入りを避けて安全にご観光ください。
