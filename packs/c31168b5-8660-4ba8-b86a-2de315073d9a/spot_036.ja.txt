Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the tour guide about the 鳥海高原花立牧場公園. Let me start by understanding the user's requirements.

First, the structure: intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. Need to use the correct proper nouns and avoid excessive metaphors. Also, include a safety note about weather, terrain, and wildlife without recommending risky behavior.

The facts given are that it's a leisure spot in the north foot of Chokai Mountain, featuring a Jersey cow farm, go-karts, park golf, and an animal interaction area. Family-friendly, can enjoy all day. 

Intro: Start with welcoming visitors and introducing the spot. Maybe something like "皆様、鳥海高原花立牧場公園へようこそ。" 

Key facts: Mention the location, the main attractions like the cow farm, go-karts, park golf, and the animal interaction area. Keep it concise.

Fun tidbit: Maybe mention the Jersey cows or the activities that make it family-friendly. For example, the cows are friendly or the variety of activities.

Safety reminder: Need to include weather, terrain, and wildlife. For example, check the weather, be cautious of uneven ground, and keep a distance from wildlife. Avoid advising specific actions like climbing or entering restricted areas.

Check for proper nouns: 鳥海高原花立牧場公園 is correct. Avoid any speculation, so if there's no info on history, don't mention it. Keep it self-contained.

Now, putting it all together. Let me make sure each section is covered and the total length is appropriate. Also, ensure the safety part is a single sentence as per the instruction.
