Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the visitor about Ganmansen Temple in the Chokai area. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The user wants a professional tour guide style in Japanese, around 45-60 seconds, so about 200-300 characters. The structure should be intro, key facts/history/nature, fun tidbit, safety reminder. Also, avoid speculation, keep it self-contained, no markdown, just plain text. And include a safety note about weather, terrain, wildlife.

First, the intro should be short. Maybe start with the location and the fact that it's a temple. Then mention the key facts: it's in Oshigata, part of the Sōtō school, and Matsuo Bashō visited here and wrote a haiku. The fun tidbit could be about the haiku's imagery, like the waves and moonlight. For safety, mention weather, terrain, and wildlife, advising caution.

Wait, the facts say it's in Oshigata, so I should make sure to include that. Also, the temple is a Sōtō Zen temple. The haiku is part of the "Oku no Hosomichi" travelogue. Need to mention that Bashō visited during his journey and composed the poem. The fun tidbit could be about the poem's imagery, like the waves and moonlight reflecting on the sea. Safety: check the weather, watch your step on the path, be aware of wildlife. Avoid recommending specific actions, just a general reminder.

Let me check the constraints again. No speculation, so if something isn't known, just say so. But in this case, the facts are provided, so I can use them. Keep it concise. Let me structure each part step by step. Make sure the tone is calm and informative. Avoid overused metaphors. Use correct terminology for the temple and the haiku. Also, the safety part needs to be a single sentence. Alright, time to put it all together.
