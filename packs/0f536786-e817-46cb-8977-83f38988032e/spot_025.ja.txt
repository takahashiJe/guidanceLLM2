Okay, let me tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically about 赤滝 (spot_025). The facts mention it's near 赓川, and the water is strong during snowmelt. 

First, I need to structure the narration as per the constraints: intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. Keep it around 200-300 characters, calm tone. Avoid speculation, so I should stick to the given facts. 

The intro should be brief, maybe mention the location. Then the key facts: location near 赓川, powerful during snowmelt. Fun tidbit could be about the name "Akataki" meaning red waterfall, maybe the color from minerals. Safety reminder needs to include weather, footing, wildlife, and not to encourage risky behavior.

Wait, the user specified to add safety considerations about weather, footing, and wildlife. Need to mention those in the safety reminder. Also, avoid over-the-top metaphors. Use plain text only. Let me check the word count. Let me draft each section step by step.

赤滝は、賀川の近くに位置する滝で、雪解け水の時期には迫力が増します。自然の力を感じられるスポットです。名前の由来は、周辺の赤い岩の影響で「紅滝」とも呼ばれています。天候や足元、野生動物に注意し、安全に楽しんでください。過度な接近や無理な行動は避けてください。
