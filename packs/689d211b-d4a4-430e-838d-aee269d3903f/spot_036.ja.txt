Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically for the spot 鳥海高原花立牧場公園. The facts provided mention it's a leisure spot in the north foot of Chokai Mountain, with a Jersey cow farm, go-karts, park golf, and an animal interaction area. The structure needs to be intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. Also, the language should be calm, around 45-60 seconds, 200-300 characters. Avoid speculation, use accurate proper nouns, no excessive metaphors. And include a safety note about weather, footing, wildlife.

First, the intro should welcome visitors and mention the location. Then key facts: mention the Jersey cows, the activities available. Fun tidbit could be something like the cow farm's name or a unique feature. Safety reminder needs to be concise, maybe about weather and wildlife. Let me check the facts again. The POI description says it's in the north foot of Chokai Mountain. So the intro could start with that. The key facts include the main attraction (Jersey cows), the other facilities. The fun tidbit might be that the park is a popular spot for families. Safety reminder: check the weather, watch your footing, be cautious of wildlife. Need to keep it self-contained, no references to other documents. Let me make sure not to add any extra info. Also, the user wants plain text only, no markdown. Let me count the characters. The example response is around 300 characters. Let me draft it step by step.
