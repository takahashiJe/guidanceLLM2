Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically about Ganmansi Temple (spot_021). The facts mention it's a Jodo-shu temple in Okinagata, visited by Matsuo Basho, and he wrote a haiku there.

First, I need to structure the narration as per the constraints: intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. Avoid overused metaphors and ensure proper nouns are correct.

Starting with the intro: introduce the temple briefly. Then mention its location and the fact that Basho visited. The key fact is the haiku. For the fun tidbit, maybe note that the temple is a quiet spot for reflection. Safety reminder needs to include weather, footing, and wildlife, without recommending excessive activity.

Wait, the user specified to avoid speculation. So if there's anything unknown, just mention it briefly. Since the facts provided are limited, I should stick to what's given. Also, make sure not to reference any external documents or context. Keep it self-contained.

Check the safety part: mention weather, footing, wildlife. Maybe say something like "Please be mindful of weather changes, uneven ground, and wildlife." Avoid suggesting specific actions beyond caution.

Now, let me draft the Japanese text. Start with the temple's name and location. Mention Basho's visit and the haiku. Add the fun fact about the peaceful atmosphere. Safety reminder with the three points. Keep it concise and within the character limit. Make sure the language is natural and flows well for a narration.
