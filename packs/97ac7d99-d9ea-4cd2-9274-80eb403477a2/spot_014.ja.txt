Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the visitor guide at the Nika-ho City Zōkai Local History Museum. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the structure should be: short intro, key facts/history, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone needs to be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so about 200-300 words. I have to use accurate names and avoid overused metaphors. Also, I need to mention safety considerations related to weather, terrain, and wildlife, without recommending excessive activities.

The facts provided are that the museum showcases the history and culture of the Zōkai area, and it was once called "Higashi no Matsumoto" (East Matsushima). I should mention that. The fun tidbit could be about the local legend of the sea goddess, which adds a cultural element. For safety, I should remind visitors to check the weather, be cautious of uneven ground, and watch for wildlife like deer or snakes.

Wait, I need to make sure not to speculate. If there's anything unknown, I should say so briefly. But the facts given are specific, so I can stick to those. Also, the output must be plain text only, no markdown. Let me check the example response to ensure I'm following the structure correctly.

Intro: Welcome to the museum. Key facts: history and culture, the old name. Fun tidbit: the sea goddess legend. Safety: weather, terrain, wildlife. Keep each section concise. Avoid any markdown, just plain text. Let me put it all together now, making sure it's within the word limit and flows naturally.

にかほ市にある象潟郷土資料館へようこそ。象潟地域の歴史や文化を紹介する博物館で、かつて「東の松島」と呼ばれた地域の変遷を学べます。館内には地元の伝承や民俗資料が展示されており、地域の風景をより深く理解する手がかりになります。興味深いのは、象潟の海に伝わる「海の女神」の神話で、昔は漁師たちの守護神として崇められていたとのことです。天候や足元に注意し、野生動物（例：鹿やキノコ）に配慮してご来館ください。
