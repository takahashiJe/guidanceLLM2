Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the tourist spot 道の駅象潟. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The user wants a professional tour guide-style narration in Japanese, about 45-60 seconds, so around 200-300 characters. The structure should have a short intro, key facts, a fun tidbit, and a safety reminder. Also, avoid speculation, keep it self-contained, and mention safety considerations like weather, terrain, and wildlife.

First, the intro should be brief. Maybe start with welcoming visitors to the area and introducing the spot. Then the key facts: it's a highway station with an outlook hot spring facing the Japan Sea, local products, seafood, and a restaurant. The fun tidbit could be that the name "象潟" comes from the ancient "Kōkai" area, which might be interesting. For safety, mention checking the weather, being cautious with the terrain, and avoiding wildlife areas.

Wait, the facts mention the POI description. I need to make sure I include the hot spring view, local products, and restaurant. The fun tidbit about the name origin is good. Safety reminder should be concise. Let me check the constraints again: no markdown, plain text, no references to the document. Also, avoid overused metaphors. Keep the tone calm and professional.

Let me draft the intro: "訪れる皆様へ、道の駅象潟へようこそ。" Then key facts: "日本海を望む展望温泉が人気の道の駅で、地元の特産品や海産物を購入でき、レストランも併設されています。" Fun tidbit: "地名の「象潟」は、古くから続く「こうがい」地域の名残りとされています。" Safety: "天候や足元にご注意ください。野生動物の出没には留意してください。"

Check the length. Maybe combine some parts. Let me count the characters. The example response is around 200-300 characters. Let me make sure each section is covered without being too verbose. Avoid any speculation, so if there's anything unknown, mention it briefly. Since the user says to avoid speculation, I don't need to add anything beyond the given facts. The safety part should be a sentence or two. Okay, that should work.
