Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration in Japanese for a tour guide at 赤滝. First, I need to make sure I understand all the requirements. The structure should be intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. Keep it around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. The tone should be calm and professional, avoiding any exaggerations or metaphors. Also, mention safety considerations like weather, footing, and wildlife without recommending risky behavior.

Starting with the intro: Greet the visitors and mention the location. Then, the key facts: it's near Fushikawa, and the waterfall is impressive during snowmelt. The fun tidbit could be something like the name meaning "red cascade" or maybe the sound it makes. For safety, remind them to watch their step, check the weather, and be aware of wildlife. Need to make sure all proper nouns are correct, like 赤滝 and 祓川. Also, avoid any speculation if there's unknown info. Let me check the facts again. The description says it's near Fushikawa and has powerful water during snowmelt. The fun fact might be the name's origin or maybe a local legend, but since the user didn't provide any, maybe stick to the name. Safety: mention weather, footing, and wildlife. Avoid saying things like "don't go near the edge" but rather "be cautious of slippery rocks" or similar. Let me draft that in Japanese, keeping it concise. Check the character count to ensure it's within the limit. Also, make sure it's plain text without markdown. Alright, let's put it all together.
