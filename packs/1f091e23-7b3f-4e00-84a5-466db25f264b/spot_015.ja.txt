Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the spot 竜ヶ原湿原 (ID: spot_015) as a tour guide. Let me start by understanding the user's requirements.

First, the user wants a professional tour guide style in Japanese, with a calm tone. The narration should be around 45-60 seconds, which translates to about 200-300 characters. I need to make sure to include the structure: short intro, key facts, fun tidbit, and safety reminder. Also, avoid speculation and keep it self-contained without referencing any documents.

The facts provided are that it's a high-altitude wetland in the middle of 鳥海山, known for its alpine plants like ワタスゲ and ニッコウキスゲ. The safety reminder should mention weather, footing, and wildlife, without recommending excessive actions.

Let me start with the intro. Maybe something like "皆様、こんにちは。今日は龍ヶ原湿原をご案内します。" That's a friendly greeting.

Next, key facts: mention it's a high-altitude wetland in the middle of 鳥海山, and the plants. Need to be concise. "鳥海山の中腹に広がる高層湿原で、ワタスゲやニッコウキスゲなどの高山植物が生育しています。" That covers the main points.

Fun tidbit: Maybe a fun fact about the plants or the area. "特にニッコウキスゲは、夏の時期に鮮やかな赤い花を咲かせ、観光客に人気です。" That adds a bit of interest without being too speculative.

Safety reminder: Need to mention weather, footing, and wildlife. "天候や足元、野生動物への配慮が必要です。特に急な傾斜や悪天候には注意してください。" That should cover the safety aspects without pushing for excessive actions.

Now, check the character count. Let me count: the example provided by the user is 227 characters. My draft should be similar. Let me make sure not to use any markdown and keep it plain text. Also, ensure that all proper nouns are correct, like ワタスゲ and ニッコウキスゲ. Avoid any metaphors or over-exaggeration. 

Wait, the user said to avoid over-exaggeration. So the fun tidbit should be straightforward. Also, make sure the safety reminder is concise. Let me review each part again to ensure it fits the structure and constraints.
