Okay, I need to create a narration for the spot "あがりこ大王" (ID: spot_001) as a tour guide. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the facts mention it's a deformed birch tree that grew from a sapling after logging. The structure needs to be: intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. Keep it around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. The tone should be calm and professional, avoiding excessive metaphors. Also, include a safety note about weather, terrain, and wildlife, without recommending risky actions.

Start with a short intro. Maybe something like "こんにちは、あがりこ大王へようこそ。" Then mention it's a unique tree. Next, the key facts: it's a deformed birch from a sapling after logging. Fun tidbit could be that it's a symbol of resilience. Safety reminder: check weather, watch your step, and be cautious of wildlife. Need to make sure not to use any speculation and keep it self-contained. Also, use the correct names. Let me check the character count. Maybe around 250 characters. Let me draft it in Japanese, ensuring the structure and constraints are met.
