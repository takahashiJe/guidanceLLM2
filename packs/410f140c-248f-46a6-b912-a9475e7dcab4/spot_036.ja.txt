Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional tour guide for visitors around Mt. Chokai area, specifically focusing on the spot called 鳥海高原花立牧場公園 (ID: spot_036). The task is to create a spoken narration in Japanese, following certain constraints. Let me break down the requirements.

First, the structure needs to be four parts: a short intro, key facts/history/nature, a fun tidbit, and a safety reminder. The tone should be calm and informative, around 45-60 seconds, which translates to about 200-300 characters. I need to avoid excessive metaphors and ensure proper nouns are accurate. Also, if there's any unknown information, I should mention it briefly. The narration should be self-contained without referencing external documents. Plus, the safety reminder must include considerations for weather, footing, and wildlife, without recommending excessive activities.

Starting with the intro: I should greet the visitors and introduce the spot. Next, the key facts. The POI description mentions it's a recreational spot in the north foot of Chokai Mountain, featuring a Jersey cow farm, go-karts, park golf, and an animal interaction area. I need to present these points clearly.

For the fun tidbit, maybe mention something unique or an interesting fact about the place. The user didn't provide specific info beyond the POI, so I might have to keep it general. Maybe the animal interaction area is a highlight.

Safety reminder: Need to mention weather, footing, and wildlife. For example, check the weather before visiting, be cautious with uneven ground, and keep a distance from wildlife. Avoid advising risky activities.

I should make sure not to speculate. Since there's no info on history, focus on the given facts. Also, keep the language natural and conversational, suitable for a guide. Let me check the character count to ensure it's within the limit. Let me draft each section step by step, then combine them.
