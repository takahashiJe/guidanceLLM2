Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional tour guide for visitors around Mt. Chokai area, specifically for the spot 鳥海高原花立牧場公園 (ID: spot_036). Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the narration needs to be in Japanese, with a calm guide tone, around 45-60 seconds, which translates to about 200-300 characters. The structure should include a short intro, key facts, a fun tidbit, and a safety reminder. Also, avoid speculation and keep it self-contained without referencing other documents.

The facts provided mention that it's a leisure spot in the north foot of Chokai Mountain, centered around a Jersey cow farm with go-karts, park golf, and an animal interaction area. The safety reminder needs to include considerations for weather, footing, and wildlife, without recommending excessive activities.

Let me start with the intro. Maybe something like welcoming visitors to the area. Then mention the main attraction, the Jersey cows. Next, the key facts: location, activities. The fun tidbit could be about the animal interaction area. For safety, remind about weather checks, stable footing, and wildlife caution.

Wait, the user specified to avoid over-the-top metaphors, so keep it straightforward. Also, ensure that any unknown information is briefly mentioned. Since the facts are given, I don't need to add anything else. Let me check the character count to ensure it's within the limit. Let me draft it step by step, then review for the structure and constraints.
