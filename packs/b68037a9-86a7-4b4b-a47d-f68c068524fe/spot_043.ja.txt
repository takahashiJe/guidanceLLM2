Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the tour guide about the 花立クリーンハイツ. Let me start by understanding the user's requirements.

First, the structure: short intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. I need to make sure to include the correct proper nouns and avoid excessive metaphors. Also, safety considerations about weather, terrain, and wildlife, but without recommending excessive activities.

The facts given are that it's a tourist facility in 鳥海高原, with a restaurant, information corner, and check-in for adjacent cottages. The popular item is the Jersey soft cream. 

Starting with the intro: Maybe something like "お盆の時期に訪れる観光拠点" to set the scene. Then mention the facilities: restaurant, info corner, check-in. The fun tidbit could be about the Jersey soft cream. For safety, mention weather, terrain, and wildlife. 

Wait, the user wants the safety reminder to include consideration for weather, footing, and wildlife. So I need to add a line about checking the weather, being cautious with the terrain, and avoiding wildlife areas. 

Let me check the character count. The example response is around 200-300 characters. Let me make sure not to use any markdown and keep it plain text. Also, avoid speculation, so if something is unknown, just say so briefly. But in this case, all the info is provided, so I don't need to mention unknowns. 

Putting it all together: 

Intro: 花立クリーンハイツは、鳥海高原の観光拠点施設。  
Key facts: レストランや観光案内コーナーがあり、隣接するコテージのチェックインも行います。ジャージーソフトクリームが人気です。  
Fun tidbit: 特にジャージーソフトクリームがおすすめです。  
Safety: 天候や足元に注意し、野生動物の出没には気をつけてください。

Wait, the example response uses the structure with the four parts. Let me make sure each part is covered. Also, the safety reminder needs to be a single sentence. 

Let me check the example response again. The user provided an example, so maybe I should follow that structure. The example starts with an intro, then key facts, then a fun tidbit, then safety. 

So, the final version should be concise, in Japanese, with the correct terms, and the safety note. Make sure it's self-contained and doesn't reference any external documents. Alright, that should cover it.
