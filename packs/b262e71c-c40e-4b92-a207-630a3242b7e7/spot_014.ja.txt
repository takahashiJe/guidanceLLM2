Okay, I need to create a spoken narration in Japanese for the visitor guide at the Nika-ho City Zōgata Village Folk Museum (ID: spot_014). Let me start by understanding the user's requirements.

First, the structure: intro, key facts/history, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. I need to avoid excessive metaphors and ensure proper nouns are accurate. Also, the safety reminder must include weather, terrain, and wildlife, without recommending excessive activities.

Starting with the intro: Introduce the museum and its purpose. Then mention the historical significance as "東の松島" (East Matsushima). The key fact is that it showcases the region's history and culture. The fun tidbit could be the local nickname or something interesting about the area. For safety, mention weather changes, uneven ground, and wildlife like deer or insects.

Wait, the facts say it's about the region's history and culture, and the change from "東の松島" to its current name. The fun tidbit might be the local nickname or a unique feature. Safety: advise checking weather, being cautious on uneven paths, and avoiding areas with wildlife.

Make sure not to speculate. If something isn't known, say so briefly. Keep it self-contained. Use plain text only. Let me check the constraints again. Avoid overuse of metaphors, keep it factual. Also, the safety part needs to be a single sentence. Let me draft each part step by step.

にかほ市にある象潟郷土資料館は、地域の歴史や文化を紹介する博物館です。かつて「東の松島」と呼ばれた象潟の変遷を学べる貴重な資料が展示されています。隣接する海岸や自然を楽しむ際は、天候の急変や足元の不整地に注意し、野生動物（例：鹿、昆虫）との遭遇には配慮してください。
