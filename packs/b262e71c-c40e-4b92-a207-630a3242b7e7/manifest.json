The safety reminder should mention weather, terrain, and wildlife without encouraging risky behavior.\n\nWait, the user specified to avoid speculation. So I shouldn't add anything not in the facts.

Maybe something like \"ようこそ、道の駅象潟へ。\" Then mention the main attraction: the view of the Japan Sea and the hot spring. \n\nNext, the key facts. I need to include the hot spring, local products, and the restaurant. Also, maybe mention the location near the mountain, since it's around Mt. Chokai. Wait, the spot is in the Mt. Chokai area, so maybe add that it's a convenient stop for visitors. \n\nThe fun tidbit should be something interesting but not too obscure.
