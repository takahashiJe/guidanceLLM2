Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration in Japanese for a tour guide at the "あがりこ大王" spot. The facts mention a deformed birch tree that grew from a sapling after logging. The structure needs to be intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder, and a safety note about weather, terrain, and wildlife.

First, I need to make sure the tone is calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. I should avoid any embellishments and stick to the facts. The key points are the tree's origin from a logging site, its unique shape, and the fun fact about local legends. The safety reminder should mention weather, terrain, and wildlife without encouraging risky behavior.

Wait, the user specified to avoid speculation. So I shouldn't add anything not in the facts. The fun tidbit is the local legend about the tree being a guardian spirit. The safety note needs to be concise. Let me check the constraints again: no references to the document, self-contained, plain text only. Also, the safety note must include considerations for weather, footing, and wildlife. 

I should start with a short intro introducing the spot. Then explain the tree's history. The fun fact is the legend. Then the safety reminder. Let me structure it in Japanese, making sure the terms are accurate. For example, "奇形ブナ" is the correct term. Also, the safety note should be a single sentence. Let me count the characters to ensure it's within the limit. Okay, that should cover all requirements.

「あがりこ大王」は、かつての伐採地に生まれた奇形ブナです。木の成長過程で異常な形状となったことで、地元の伝説では「山の守護神」とも呼ばれています。木の歪みは自然の力によるもので、その姿はまるで太古の神の手が刻んだかのように、不思議な存在感を放ちます。ただし、足元は滑りやすく、天候によっては急な降水が発生する可能性もあるため、ご注意ください。また、周辺には野生動物が生息しているため、立ち入りはお避けください。
