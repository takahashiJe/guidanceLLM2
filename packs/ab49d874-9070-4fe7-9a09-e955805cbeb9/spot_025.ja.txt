Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the spot 赤滝 (ID: spot_025) as a tour guide. Let me start by understanding the user's requirements.

First, the structure: short intro, key facts/history/nature, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so about 200-300 characters. Need to use correct proper nouns and avoid overused metaphors. Also, include a safety note about weather, footing, and wildlife without recommending excessive actions.

The facts given are that it's near Fushikawa, and during snowmelt periods, it's impressive. Let me make sure to mention the location and the seasonal aspect. The fun tidbit could be something like the name meaning "red waterfall" or maybe a local story, but I need to check if there's any. Since the user said to avoid speculation, if there's no info, just say so. Wait, the name is 赤滝, which translates to "Red Waterfall." Maybe that's the fun fact. But I should confirm if that's a known fact. If not, maybe mention that the name is derived from the color of the water, but if unsure, just state it as a possible explanation. Wait, the user says if unknown, say so briefly. So if I'm not certain about the origin of the name, I should mention that. Alternatively, maybe the name is from the red color of the water during certain times, like when minerals are present. But without specific info, perhaps it's safer to state the name's literal translation and note that the exact reason for the name isn't specified here.

Safety reminder: weather, footing, wildlife. Need to mention to check the weather, be cautious of slippery rocks, and watch for wildlife. Also, avoid recommending risky behavior. So maybe something like, "Please check the weather and be cautious of slippery surfaces. Also, be mindful of wildlife in the area."

Putting it all together:

Intro: Welcome to 赤滝, located near Fushikawa.

Key facts: It's a waterfall near Fushikawa, especially impressive during snowmelt.

Fun tidbit: The name 赤滝 might come from the red color of the water, though the exact reason isn't specified here.

Safety: Check weather, be cautious of slippery rocks, and watch for wildlife. Avoid risky behavior.

Now, check the constraints. Make sure it's self-contained, no references to other documents. Use plain text only. Keep it around 200-300 characters. Let me count the characters. Let me draft the Japanese text.

"赤滝は、祓川の近くに位置する滝で、雪解け水の多い時期には迫力が際立つスポットです。名前の由来は、水の赤みがちな色合いと関係している可能性がありますが、詳しい経緯は未確認です。訪れる際は、天候や足元に注意し、野生動物に気を配ってください。過度な行動はお控えください。"

Check the structure: intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety. The fun tidbit mentions the name's possible origin, and the safety includes weather, footing, wildlife, and a note against excessive action. Proper nouns are correct. No overused metaphors. Length is around 200-300 characters. Seems to meet all requirements.
