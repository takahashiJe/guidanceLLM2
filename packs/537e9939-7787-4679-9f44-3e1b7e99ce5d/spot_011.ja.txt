Okay, let me tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically about 道の駅象潟 (spot_011). The facts mention it's a viewpoint with a hot spring, local products, and a restaurant. The structure needs to be intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. 

First, I need to start with a short intro. Maybe something like welcoming visitors to the area and introducing the spot. Then the key facts: the view of the Japan Sea, the onsen, and the available products and restaurant. 

For the fun tidbit, maybe mention that the name "象潟" has a historical story, like a legend about a heron. That adds a local flavor without being speculative. 

Safety reminder: Weather, footing, and wildlife. Since it's a coastal area, mention checking weather and being cautious with slippery surfaces. Also, note wildlife like deer or birds, but avoid advising specific actions. 

I need to keep it around 200-300 characters, so concise. Avoid any markdown and use plain text. Make sure to use the correct names and not overuse metaphors. Check that all info is accurate based on the provided facts and don't add anything beyond that. Also, ensure the safety part is brief but covers the essentials.
