Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the Nihonkai City Shōkai Kōzōshi Kan (ID: spot_014) as a tour guide. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the structure should be: short intro, key facts/history/nature, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone needs to be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so about 200-300 words. I have to avoid speculation and keep it self-contained. Also, include a safety note about weather, terrain, and wildlife without recommending excessive activities.

The facts given are that it's a museum showcasing the history and culture of the Shōkai area, once called "Higashi no Matsushima" (Eastern Matsushima). I should mention that. The fun tidbit could be about the local nickname. For safety, remind visitors to check the weather, watch their steps, and be cautious of wildlife.

I need to make sure the place names are correct. Let me check the Japanese name again: にかほ市 象潟郷土資料館. The museum's name in Japanese is 象潟郷土資料館. The nickname is "東の松島" which translates to "Eastern Matsushima." 

Avoiding overused metaphors, so keep the language straightforward. Start with a welcoming intro. Then mention the museum's purpose and the historical nickname. The fun fact could be that it's known as "Eastern Matsushima." For safety, mention weather, terrain, and wildlife. 

Wait, the user said to avoid over-the-top metaphors, so phrases like "like a gem" are out. Keep it simple. Also, make sure to note that if there's any unknown info, say so briefly. Since the facts provided are specific, I don't need to add anything else. 

Let me structure it step by step. Intro: Welcome to the museum. Key facts: history and culture, the nickname. Fun tidbit: the local name. Safety: check weather, watch steps, wildlife. 

Double-check the word count. Let me draft it in Japanese now.
