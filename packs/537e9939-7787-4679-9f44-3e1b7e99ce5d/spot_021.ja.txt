Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for a tour guide about the Ganmansi Temple (蚶満寺) in the Chokai area. The user provided specific facts and constraints. Let me break down the requirements.

First, the structure: short intro, key facts/history/nature, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. I need to avoid overused metaphors and ensure proper nouns are accurate. Also, the safety reminder must include considerations for weather, footing, and wildlife, without recommending excessive activities.

Starting with the intro: Mention the location and that it's a temple. Then the key facts: it's a Jodo-shu temple in Ohashi, visited by Matsuo Basho, who wrote a haiku. The fun tidbit could be about the haiku's imagery. For safety, remind visitors to check the weather, watch their step, and be cautious of wildlife.

Wait, the facts say it's in Ohashi, but the POI description mentions "象潟" which is Ohashi. So I should use that. Also, the haiku is part of the key facts. The fun tidbit could be that the haiku captures the scenery. Safety: mention weather, footing, and wildlife. Avoid speculation, so if I'm unsure about anything, just say so briefly. Keep it self-contained. No markdown, plain text.

Let me check the character count. Let me draft:

" Ganmansi Temple (spot_021) is located in Ohashi, a Jodo-shu temple where Matsuo Basho visited and composed a haiku during his 'Oku no Hosomichi' journey. The temple's serene atmosphere reflects the natural beauty of the area. A fun fact: Basho's haiku captures the tranquil scenery of the surrounding landscape. Please check the weather and footing, and be mindful of wildlife to ensure a safe visit."

That's about 200 characters. Let me count: " Ganmansi Temple (spot_021) is located in Ohashi, a Jodo-shu temple where Matsuo Basho visited and composed a haiku during his 'Oku no Hosomichi' journey. The temple's serene atmosphere reflects the natural beauty of the area. A fun fact: Basho's haiku captures the tranquil scenery of the surrounding landscape. Please check the weather and footing, and be mindful of wildlife to ensure a safe visit." 

That's 200 characters. Maybe adjust for flow and ensure all points are covered. Also, the safety reminder needs to be concise. Maybe "Please check the weather and footing, and be mindful of wildlife to ensure a safe visit." That's good. I think that meets the requirements.

 Ganmansi Temple (spot_021)は象潟にある曹洞宗の寺院で、松尾芭蕉が「おくのほそ道」の旅で訪れ、句を詠んだ歴史があります。境内は自然と調和した静かな空間で、四季折々の風景が楽しめます。おもしろいのは、芭蕉が詠んだ句に「月の光が海を照らす」というイメージが込められていること。天候や足元の状態を確認し、野生動物との遭遇に配慮してご訪問ください。
