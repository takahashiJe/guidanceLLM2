Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the spot 竜ヶ原湿原 (ID: spot_015) as a tour guide. Let me start by understanding the user's requirements.

First, the structure: intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. Need to use the correct proper nouns and avoid excessive metaphors. Also, include a safety note about weather, footing, and wildlife, without recommending excessive activities.

The facts given are that it's a high-altitude wetland in the middle of 鳥海山, known for plants like ワタスゲ and ニッコウキスゲ. The fun tidbit could be something about the plants or the area's features. Safety reminder should mention weather, terrain, and wildlife.

Let me start with the intro. Maybe something like "ご案内します" to start. Then mention it's a high-altitude wetland in the middle of 鳥海山. Next, the key facts: it's a treasure trove for alpine plants. Then the fun tidbit: maybe the plants bloom in summer, creating a colorful landscape. For safety, remind visitors to check the weather, be cautious of the terrain, and watch out for wildlife.

Wait, the user said to avoid speculation. So if I don't know something, I should say so briefly. But in this case, the facts are provided, so I can use them. Also, keep it self-contained, no references to other documents. Output plain text only.

Let me check the character count. The example response is around 200-300 characters. Let me make sure each section is covered concisely. Maybe the intro is a sentence, then the key facts, then the fun fact, then the safety reminder. Avoid any markdown, just plain text. Also, the safety note should be a single sentence. Let me put it all together.

ご案内します。竜ヶ原湿原は、鳥海山の中腹に広がる高層湿原で、ワタスゲやニッコウキスゲなど高山植物の宝庫です。夏には鮮やかな花々が咲き、自然の美しさを楽しめます。ただし、天候の急変や滑りやすい足元、野生動物の出没に注意が必要です。安全に楽しんでください。
