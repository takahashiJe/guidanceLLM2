Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the visitor guide at the Nika-ho City Shōgata Local History Museum. Let me start by understanding the user's requirements.

First, the structure: intro, key facts/history, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The user wants a calm, professional tone, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. I need to make sure to use the correct proper nouns and avoid excessive metaphors. Also, the safety part should mention weather, terrain, and wildlife, without recommending excessive activities.

The facts given are that the museum showcases the history and culture of the Shōgata area, and it was once called "Higashi no Matsushima" (East Matsushima). I should mention that the museum explains the area's transformation. 

For the intro, maybe start with welcoming visitors and introducing the museum. Then the key facts: the museum's purpose and the historical name. The fun tidbit could be about the local name or something unique about the area. Safety: remind visitors to check the weather, be cautious of uneven ground, and watch out for wildlife, but without suggesting specific actions beyond that.

I need to keep it self-contained, not referencing any external documents. Avoid speculation if there's unknown info. Let me check the length. Let me draft in Japanese, keeping it concise. Make sure the proper nouns are correct, like the museum's name and the historical name. Also, the safety reminder should be a single sentence. Let me put it all together now.

にかほ市にある「象潟郷土資料館」は、地元の歴史や文化を紹介する博物館です。かつて「東の松島」と呼ばれた象潟の変遷を学べます。館内には地域の資料が展示され、自然と人とのつながりを感じられます。おもしろい知識として、象潟の名前の由来は「象の潟」という地形から来るともいわれます。天候や足元に注意し、野生動物との遭遇には気を配ってください。
