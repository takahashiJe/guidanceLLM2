Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically for the Nika-ho City Shōkai Local History Museum (ID: spot_014). The facts provided mention that the museum showcases the history and culture of the Shōkai region, and it was once called "The East's Mutsu Bay." 

First, I need to structure the narration into four parts: a short intro, key facts/history, a fun tidbit, and a safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, which translates to about 200-300 characters in Japanese. I have to avoid speculation and ensure accuracy, especially with proper nouns.

Starting with the intro: Introduce the museum as a place where visitors can learn about the region's history and culture. Mention the nickname "The East's Mutsu Bay" to highlight its significance. 

Next, the key facts: The museum's role in showcasing the area's transformation over time. Maybe mention the exhibits, but since the facts don't specify, I should stick to what's given. 

For the fun tidbit: The nickname comparison to Mutsu Bay could be a good point. Maybe add that it's a unique local charm. 

Safety reminder: Need to include weather, terrain, and wildlife. Since the user specified to avoid recommending excessive activity, I should mention caution regarding weather changes, uneven ground, and wildlife encounters without suggesting specific actions. 

Check for proper nouns: Ensure "にかほ市 象潟郷土資料館" is correctly used. Avoid any metaphors or over-imaginative language. Keep it self-contained without referencing external documents. 

Now, putting it all together concisely. Make sure each section flows naturally. Let me count the characters to stay within the limit. Also, ensure the safety part is a single sentence as requested. Let me review each part again to confirm accuracy and adherence to constraints.
