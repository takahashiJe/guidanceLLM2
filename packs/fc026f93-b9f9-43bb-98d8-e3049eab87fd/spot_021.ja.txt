Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically about Ganmansen Temple (spot_021). The facts mention it's a Jodo-shu temple in Ohashi, visited by Matsuo Basho who wrote a haiku there. 

First, I need to structure it into four parts: intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone should be calm and informative, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. Avoid overused metaphors and ensure proper nouns are correct.

Starting with the intro: mention the temple's location and its significance. Then key facts: the temple's affiliation, Basho's visit and the haiku. Fun tidbit could be that the haiku is a popular attraction. Safety reminder needs to include weather, terrain, and wildlife without recommending risky actions. 

Wait, the user specified to avoid speculation. So if there's any uncertain info, just say so briefly. But the facts provided are clear. Need to check if the haiku is indeed part of the temple's history. The original facts say Basho visited and wrote a haiku there, so that's a key fact. The fun tidbit can mention the haiku as a highlight.

Safety: remind visitors to check weather, be cautious of uneven ground, and watch for wildlife. Keep it concise. Also, make sure the entire text is plain, no markdown. Let me put it all together now.

散策の途中、象潟に位置する「 Ganmansen 寺（がんまんざんじ）」をご案内します。曹洞宗の寺院で、松尾芭蕉が「おくのほそ道」の旅で訪れ、句を詠んだ歴史があります。境内は自然に囲まれ、静かな空間を楽しめます。お参りの際は、芭蕉が詠んだ句を思い浮かべてみてください。天候や足元の悪さに注意し、野生動物に遭遇する際は距離を保ってください。ご安全に。
