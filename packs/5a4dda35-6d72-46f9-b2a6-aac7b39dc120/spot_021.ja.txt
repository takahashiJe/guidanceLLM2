Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically about Ganmansen Temple (ID: spot_021). The facts mention it's a Jodo-shu temple in Oshika, visited by Matsuo Basho, and he composed a haiku there.

First, I need to structure it into four parts: intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The tone should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. Avoid overused metaphors and ensure proper nouns are correct. Also, include a safety note about weather, terrain, and wildlife without recommending risky actions.

Start with the intro: mention the temple's location and its significance. Then, key facts: it's a Jodo-shu temple in Oshika, visited by Basho who wrote a haiku. The fun tidbit could be that the temple's name relates to the surrounding area, like the shellfish. For safety, mention checking weather, being cautious on uneven ground, and avoiding wildlife areas.

Wait, the user specified to avoid speculation. If there's unknown info, just say so briefly. Since the facts provided don't mention anything else, I can stick to what's given. Also, make sure the safety part is concise. Let me check the character count. Let me draft each section and ensure it's within the limit. Avoid any markdown, just plain text. Alright, let's put it all together.

静かな海岸沿いに位置する「 Ganmansen じょう」は、象潟にある曹洞宗の寺院です。松尾芭蕉が「おくのほそ道」の旅で訪れ、その地の情景を詠んだ句が伝えられています。境内には、海風に吹かれながらも静かな空気が流れます。興味深いのは、寺名の由来が周辺の貝殻を連想させる言葉から来ていること。足元の湿った砂地や、潮風の影響で視界が曇る場合があるため、天候や地形に注意し、野生動物の生息域には立ち入らないよう心がけてください。
