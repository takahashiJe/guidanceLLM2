Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically for the spot 花立クリーンハイツ. The facts provided include it being a tourist hub with a restaurant, information center, and check-in for cottages, plus the popular Jersey soft cream.

First, I need to structure the narration into four parts: intro, key facts, fun tidbit, and safety reminder. The tone should be calm and informative, around 45-60 seconds. Let me start with the intro. Maybe something like welcoming visitors to the area and introducing the spot.

Next, key facts: mention it's a tourist facility, the restaurant, info corner, check-in for cottages, and the soft cream. Need to keep it concise. Then the fun tidbit—maybe the Jersey soft cream is a local favorite. For the safety reminder, mention weather, footing, and wildlife. Avoid over-the-top advice, just a brief note.

Wait, the user specified to avoid speculation and keep it self-contained. So I shouldn't add anything beyond the given facts. Also, check for any unknowns. Since the facts are provided, I can stick to those. Let me make sure the structure is clear and each part is covered. Also, ensure the safety part is included as per the instructions. Let me draft each section step by step, keeping the language natural and within the character limit.
