Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration for a tour guide in the Mt. Chokai area, specifically about 鳥海山の中腹の高層湿原, 竜ヶ原湿原. The structure needs to be intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. Also, they want it in Japanese, calm guide tone, around 45-60 seconds, 200-300 characters. Avoid speculation, keep self-contained, no references to documents. Plus, safety considerations about weather, terrain, wildlife.

First, I need to start with a short intro. Maybe something like "こんにちは、龍ヶ原湿原へようこそ" to welcome visitors. Then mention it's a highland marsh in the middle of Chokai Mountain. Next, the key facts: it's a treasure trove of alpine plants like Watasgae and Nikko Iris. Need to include the POI description accurately. 

For the fun tidbit, maybe mention that it's a popular spot for photography or that the colors change with the seasons. But wait, the user said to avoid overused metaphors, so maybe just a simple fact. Maybe that the area is a haven for botanists? Or that it's a great place for spotting wildlife. Wait, the facts mention the plants, so maybe the fun tidbit could be about the vibrant colors in summer or something like that.

Safety reminder: need to mention weather, terrain, wildlife. For example, weather can change quickly, so check the forecast. The terrain is uneven, so be cautious. Wildlife like bears or snakes might be present, so stay on marked paths. Also, avoid recommending excessive activities, so maybe just a general reminder to follow safety guidelines.

Now, checking the constraints. No speculation, so if I don't know something, I should say so briefly. But the facts provided are sufficient. Need to keep it self-contained. Also, avoid overused metaphors. Let me structure each part step by step.

Intro: Welcome and location. Key facts: describe the marsh, mention the plants. Fun tidbit: maybe the seasonal beauty. Safety: weather, terrain, wildlife. Make sure to use the correct names like ワタスゲ and ニッコウキスゲ. Also, the safety part should be a sentence or two. Let me count the characters to ensure it's within the limit. Let me draft it in Japanese now.
