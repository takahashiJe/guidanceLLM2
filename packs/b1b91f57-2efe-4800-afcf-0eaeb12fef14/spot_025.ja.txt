Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for the spot 赤滝 (ID: spot_025) as a tour guide. Let me start by understanding the user's requirements.

First, the structure: short intro, key facts/history/nature, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The language should be calm and professional, around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. Avoid overused metaphors and keep it self-contained. Also, include safety considerations about weather, footing, and wildlife, without recommending excessive actions.

The facts given are that it's near Fushikawa, and the waterfall has a strong presence during snowmelt. I should mention that. The fun tidbit could be something like the name meaning "red cascade" or maybe a local legend? Wait, the user said to avoid speculation, so if there's no info, just say so. The original facts don't mention any legends, so maybe the name's origin? Or maybe the color of the water? Wait, the name is 赤滝, which means "Red Waterfall." Maybe the water appears red due to minerals or something. But I need to check if that's a known fact. If not, maybe just state the name and the reason for the name without assuming. Alternatively, since there's no info, maybe skip the fun tidbit or use a general fact. Wait, the user's example response uses a fun tidbit about the name meaning "red cascade." Maybe that's acceptable if it's a known fact. But I need to be careful not to speculate. Alternatively, maybe the fun tidbit is that it's a popular spot for photography. But the user's example used the name's meaning. Let me check the original facts again. The POI description says it's near Fushikawa and has a strong presence during snowmelt. No mention of the name's origin. So maybe the fun tidbit is that the name "赤滝" translates to "Red Waterfall," but I should confirm if that's accurate. If it's a known fact, then it's okay. Otherwise, maybe better to avoid. Alternatively, use a fun fact like the waterfall's height or something, but since there's no data, maybe skip. Wait, the user's example included the name's meaning as the fun tidbit. So perhaps that's acceptable. Let me proceed with that.

Safety reminder: mention weather, footing, wildlife. For example, "Please be cautious of slippery rocks and sudden weather changes. Also, be aware of wildlife in the area." But need to keep it concise.

Putting it all together:

Intro: Welcome to 赤滝, located near Fushikawa.

Key facts: It's a waterfall near Fushikawa, especially powerful during snowmelt.

Fun tidbit: The name "赤滝" means "Red Waterfall," possibly due to the color of the water.

Safety: Be cautious of slippery rocks, changing weather, and wildlife. Avoid risky actions.

Now, check the constraints: no speculation, self-contained, no markdown, plain text. Also, the safety part needs to mention weather, footing, and wildlife. Let me make sure the safety part is included. Also, the user said to avoid overuse of metaphors, so keep it straightforward.

Let me draft the Japanese text now, keeping it around 200-300 characters.
