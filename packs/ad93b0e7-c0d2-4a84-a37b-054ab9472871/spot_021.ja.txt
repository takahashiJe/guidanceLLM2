Okay, I need to create a spoken narration for a tour guide about Ganmangu Temple (spot_021) in the Chokai area. The user specified the structure: short intro, key facts/history/nature, fun tidbit, safety reminder. Let me start by breaking down the facts provided.

First, the temple is in Ohashi, part of the Soto school, and it's where Matsuo Basho visited and wrote a haiku. I should mention that in the key facts section. The intro should welcome visitors and mention the temple's location. 

Next, the fun tidbit. The user mentioned avoiding speculation, so I need to find a known fact. Maybe that the temple's name comes from the nearby shellfish? Wait, the name is Ganmangu, which might relate to the area's name. Wait, the POI description says it's in Ohashi, so maybe the temple's name is linked to the area's shellfish. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the haiku itself is a fun tidbit. The user said to include a fun fact, so perhaps the fact that the temple is known for the haiku. Wait, the main fact is that Basho visited and wrote a haiku. So maybe the fun tidbit is that the haiku is still remembered. Or maybe the temple's location in a bay where shellfish are abundant. Wait, the POI description says it's in Ohashi, which might be a place with shellfish. So the temple's name might relate to that. But I need to check if that's accurate. Since the user provided the facts, I should stick to what's given. The POI description mentions it's in Ohashi, a place with shellfish. So maybe the temple's name comes from the shellfish. Alternatively, the name "Ganmangu" could be a reference to the area. 

Wait, the POI description says it's in Ohashi, which is a place with shellfish. So the temple's name might be related. However, the user's facts don't explicitly state that. So I need to be careful. The key facts should be accurate. The fun tidbit could be that the temple's name comes from the local shellfish. But since the user's facts don't mention that, I should avoid speculation. Wait, the user said to avoid speculation and if unknown, say so briefly. So if I'm not sure about the origin of the name, I should mention that. 

Alternatively, the fun tidbit could be that the temple is a popular spot for visitors to see the haiku. But the main point is that Basho visited and wrote a haiku there. So maybe the fun tidbit is that the haiku is still a famous piece. 

For the safety reminder, the user wants a note about weather, footing, and wildlife. So I need to mention to be cautious of weather conditions, unstable ground, and wildlife. 

Putting it all together:

Intro: Welcome to Ganmangu Temple, located in Ohashi, a Gozan temple. 

Key facts: It's a Soto school temple where Basho visited and wrote a haiku. 

Fun tidbit: The temple is known for the haiku that still resonates today. 

Safety: Check the weather, watch your step, and be aware of wildlife. 

Wait, the user's facts don't mention the temple's name origin, so I shouldn't speculate. So the fun tidbit should be something else. Maybe the fact that the temple is surrounded by nature, or that it's a peaceful place. But the user's facts don't mention that. Wait, the POI description says it's in Ohashi, which is a place with shellfish. So maybe the temple's name comes from the shellfish. But since the user's facts don't state that, I should avoid it. 

Alternatively, the fun tidbit could be that the temple is a popular spot for visitors to see the haiku. 

So the structure would be:

Intro: Welcome to Ganmangu Temple, located in Ohashi, a Gozan temple.

Key facts: As a Soto school temple, it's known for the haiku written by Basho during his journey in "Oku no Hosomichi."

Fun tidbit: The temple's serene atmosphere invites visitors to reflect on his poetic legacy.

Safety: Please be mindful of weather conditions, unstable ground, and potential wildlife in the surrounding area.

That should fit within 200-300 characters. Let me check the length. The example response given by the user is 246 characters. So I need to keep it concise. Also, avoid overusing metaphors. Let me make sure all the constraints are met: proper nouns, structure, safety reminder, no speculation. Yes, that should work.
