Okay, let's see. The user wants a narration for a tour guide at the 道の駅象潟. The facts mention it's a viewpoint with a hot spring overlooking the Japan Sea, sells local specialties and seafood, and has a restaurant. The structure needs to be intro, key facts, fun tidbit, safety reminder. Also, keep it around 45-60 seconds, so 200-300 characters. Need to use the correct names, avoid overused metaphors. Safety part should mention weather, footing, wildlife, and avoid recommending excessive activities.

First, start with a short intro. Maybe something like "こんにちは、道の駅象潟へようこそ。" Then mention the view of the Japan Sea and the hot spring. Next, key facts: the restaurant and local products. Fun tidbit could be about the name "象潟" meaning "elephant marsh," but I should check if that's accurate. Wait, maybe it's a local name, so maybe it's better to say it's a local name with a story. Wait, the facts don't mention the name's origin, so maybe avoid speculation. The user said to avoid speculation if unknown. So maybe the fun tidbit is that the restaurant serves fresh seafood. Safety reminder: check the weather, watch your step on slippery paths, and be cautious of wildlife like deer. But don't recommend specific activities. Let me make sure the safety part is concise. Also, keep the tone calm and informative. Let me put it all together now.
