Okay, let me tackle this query. The user wants a spoken narration in Japanese for a tour guide at the Nika-ho City Shōkai-ko Local History Museum. The constraints are pretty specific, so I need to make sure I hit all the points.

First, the structure: intro, key facts/history, fun tidbit, safety reminder. The intro should be short, maybe a welcoming statement. Then the key facts—mention the museum's purpose, the historical name "Higashi no Matsushima," and its role in showing the region's transformation. The fun tidbit could be about the local legend, like the whale statue. Safety reminder needs to include weather, footing, and wildlife, without recommending specific actions.

I need to keep it around 200-300 characters. Let me check the example response. It starts with "こんにちは、にかほ市象潟郷土資料館へようこそ。" That's a good intro. Then the key facts: the museum's role, the historical name, and the transition. The fun tidbit about the whale statue and the legend. Safety reminder mentions weather, footing, and wildlife, advising caution.

I should avoid speculation, so if there's anything unknown, just say so briefly. The example doesn't mention anything unknown, so maybe that's okay. Also, no markdown, just plain text. Let me make sure the tone is calm and professional, not too flowery. Check the length—should be 45-60 seconds. The example is about 200 characters, so that's good. Need to make sure all the constraints are met. Alright, I think that's covered.
